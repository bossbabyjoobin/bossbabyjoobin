SeoAh's thoughts late at night

#SeoAh #서아

🌊 How much does SeoAh like herself?

Hmm.. it changes every day
Not everyone can be perfect or good at everything, so it’s always different  
Still, I try each time to be someone I can like
There are things I can’t change even if I try and things that work out when I put in the effort
I wish time wouldn’t pass by so fast 
It always feels too quick, leaving me a bit regretful
Precious memories fade little by little over time, which is the biggest regret.  
I can’t believe it’ll be 2025 in just a few months. It feels like I watched the New Year’s bell ringing in the city on January 1 just yesterday—so vivid still.  
And in a few months, it'll ring again. As time passes, I’ll probably find myself an adult one day, haha.  
Time is fair, after all.

🌊 **HaeRin, do you not want to grow up?**

It’s not that I don’t want to, but I think there will be more things I feel bittersweet about.  
I guess I’ll still have things to regret as an adult since it’s not something I can change just by trying.  
I’ll just have to do my best not to worry about it, haha.  
Nah, I’m not that young anymore. Thinking that way makes it easier, haha.  
Late-night thoughts 😎😎 haha

🌊 **SeoAh, how much do you like yourself?**

Hmm, it’s different every day. No one is perfect, and no one can do everything well, so it changes constantly.  
Still, I always try to be happy with myself.  
There are parts of me that don’t improve even with effort, and parts that do improve when I try.  
I wish time wouldn’t pass.  
It goes by too quickly, and I’m left wishing for more every time.  
As time goes on, precious memories gradually fade away.  
That’s what I miss the most.  
I can’t believe it’ll be 2025 in just a few months.  
It feels like I just saw the bell ringing downtown on January 1st, and it’s still so vivid.  
In a few months, it’ll ring again.  
As time passes, someday, I’ll also find myself an adult.  
ㅋㅋ Time is fair, after all.

🌊 **Haerin, don’t you want to become an adult?!?**

It’s not that I don’t want to; it just feels like there will be a lot of things I’ll miss.  
Even as an adult, I think I’ll still have things I’ll miss since it’s something I can’t change just by trying.  
I’ll just have to do my best not to dwell on it.  
ㅋㅋ  
Come on, I’m not that young.  
Thinking this way is easier ㅋㅋ.  
ㅋㅋ Late-night vibes 😎😎 ㅋㅋ.

"What do you mean adolescence!?!?!?!"

🌊 SeoAh~ I'm curious... are you still flirting with JooBin these days? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

No no ㅋㅋ  
My aegyo decreased a bit ㅋㅋ
Even the stylists say so 
They say I’ve matured ㅋㅋ  
I can't act cute these days
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
What do you mean adolescence!?!?!?!
-.-  
I’m leaving  
-3-  
ㅋㅋ  

🌊 SeoAh, I’m not going to school tomorrow. Aren’t you jealous? ㅋ  

…  
Go away  
😑  
I like being at home…  
Especially now that it’s colder, I think that’s part of it
And Seoul is dizzying…  
It’s so big…  
Too many people  
It’s exhausting…  
That’s why I like being at home

🌊 What do you usually do at home?

Sleep  
Sleep is the best
I sleep, watch YouTube  
and do this and that  
But if I wake up after 10 
the day just flies by  
It feels like everything goes by too fast
yet I still end up waking up after 10 every time
😁😁  
Only on days off ㅋㅋ ㅜㅜ  
I'm really going to school…  
For real
These days, the nights feel so long
I don't like winter 🥲🥲🥲  
Now we’re all eyeing when to bring out our padded jackets  
Ji SuhYeon unnie already wore hers…  
🫢🫢🫢🫢🫢  
For now, I can still manage…
By next month, I’ll have to take out mine too

🌊 SeoAh, is there a song from another unit you'd like to cover?

I don't think I have one yet
Door?
I've been into ballads lately
