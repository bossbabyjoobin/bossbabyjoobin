SeoAh wants to take her members to a baseball game

#SeoAh #서아

Later, I’d like to take a few members to a baseball game
If it’s possible next year...
Among the members, is there anyone who likes baseball?  
But I do think a few of them like football
I don't really know much about football...
As far as I can remember, I think the first football match I ever watched was in Ulsan
If I got into football too
I think it would be too much...  
I’d literally be broke~  
<sup>[t/n: She’s been into baseball recently, buying jerseys and, of course, tickets for games]</sup>
