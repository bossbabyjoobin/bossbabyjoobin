#SeoAh #서아

Hiii  
What are you doing
Please give lots of love and support to VV
💕💕  
I have a picture from yesterday
Should I send it or not?

Tada  
We're leaving Changwon and heading to Seoul now  
Today's song recommendation
LOSER - BIGBANG sunbaenim  
I'm listening to it right now  
Did you watch VV unnies stage today??  
I haven’t seen it yet..ㅜ  
SoHyun unnie  
I’ve fallen for her all over again
I was already into her 
but I saw her at the salon today and wow...  
Dal-nim 🥹🥹💕💕  
<sup>[t/n: SoHyun's nickname, it's from their pairing name 햇님달님 (Haet-nim dal-nim)<sup>(SunMoonz)</sup>]</sup> 
크크
When I was watching the first round last time, Binnie unnie asked why I was getting mad and then happy all by myself ㅋㅋ  
<sup>[t/n: Korean Series match (KIA Tigers vs Samsung Lions), winning team will be crowned the champion for this season]</sup>
ㅋㅋ  
I’ve been doing the same these days just practicing and stuff
[Y/N], what have you been up to?  
Everyone's been working hard  
🌊 Please do the Hit the Floor challenge  

?  
No….🥲  <sup>[EN]</sup>
I can’t…🥲🥲🥲  
It's hard
I like WaveWay by Say My Name too
Dohee unnie and I went to the same academy  <sup>[t/n: Joy Dance Music Gwangju]</sup>
ㅋㅋ  
Bit by bit  
I guess there will be more idols born in 2010s now  <sup>[SAY MY NAME's maknae is also a 10 liner]</sup>
Time flies  
-.-
Another song recommendation  
Find Myself Again by Blanks

🌊 Are you listening to it right now?

Yes ㅋㅋ  
🌊 Do you shuffle through your playlist or listen in order?

I listen on repeat
and if I want to listen to something else, I just switch to that
🌊 So, you just repeat one song until you feel like changing it?


Yup, exactly
🌊 What’s your favorite song recently?

Time Bomb..💣<sup>[EN]</sup> <sup>[by The Chainsmokers]</sup> 
It gives me energy  
🌊 SeoAh, do you know the singer named keshi? Feels like your kind of style, you should check it out!!!

Of course, I listen often  
Oh my god
I'm so nervous for tomorrow <sup>[t/n: Game 3 of the series, KIA leads 2 - 0]</sup>
Korean Series  
Hope everything goes safely  
🌊 Do you have a pledge if your team wins the Korean Series? <sup>[KIA Tigers, SeoAh's Hometown team]</sup>

Me…..?  
I’ll send you an old pic I took with Hosun... <sup>[KIA Tigers' Mascot]</sup>
Not with Hoyeon but with Hosun   
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It’s getting cold these days, so dress warmly  
and eat some bungeoppang
🌊 How much is it these days? Three for a thousand won?

It’s two for a thousand won now  
I’m team red bean bungeoppang
5 for 1000 won..?  
What year is this? 
I’ll take a time capsule back there
Ackㅋㅋㅋ 
They said it used to be like that back in the day
Wow...  
🌊 Real red bean bungeoppang should have chunky red bean filling, not that mousse-type paste... Now I really want some 

Ours have chunks  
I'm going now
Sleep well in advance  
You worked hard today too
