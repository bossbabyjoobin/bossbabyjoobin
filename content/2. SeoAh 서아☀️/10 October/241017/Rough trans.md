나중에
멤버 몇명 데꼬
야구장 데꼬 가고 싶어
내년에 할수 있다면..
멤버중에
야구 좋아하는 멤버?
없는거 가튼데
축구는 몇명 좋아하는거 같던뎅
난 축구 몰라..
축구장
내 기억으로는
울산이 처음인거 같아
나
축구 까지 좋아하면
으악
힘들거 가타..
말 그대로 파산핑 ~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
지금
축구도 국대하나?
아 예선이구나
나는 이만 간당
미리 잘자고
안뇽
오늘도 고생했어

SeoAh wants to take her members to a baseball game

#SeoAh #서아


Later, I’d like to take a few members to a baseball game
If it’s possible next year...
Among the members, is there anyone who likes baseball?  
But I do think a few of them like football
I don't really know much about football...
As far as I can remember, I think the first football match I ever watched was in Ulsan
If I got into football too
I think it would be too much...  
I’d literally be broke~  
<sup>[t/n: She’s been into baseball recently, buying jerseys and, of course, tickets for games]</sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
<br>



Apologies for not translating SeoAh's fromm these days since she only talks about baseball these days. I basically have to keep up with KBO league to understand what she's talking about sometimes, I hope you understand ~ But I think she's back in the HAUS so. 

VM from yesterday, Sullin and HaYeon ^~^

By the way, here’s a voice message from yesterday with Sullin and HaYeon ^~^
