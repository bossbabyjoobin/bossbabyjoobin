Heyyy  
I totally bombed the test  
Keke

Here's a gift  
You know those days...  
When you suddenly feel like turning on the fan in the middle of the night and filming a video...  
🌊 The dot is getting darker and darker, right? Lol, did I draw it??? 🫶  

It's always been my spot...  
🌊 Ha Jae-rin, you're addicted to Kia Tigers!!!  

Sorry,  
I'm watching baseball right now  
No, lol  
That video  
It's not recent, lol  
It’s from last month  
These days,  
it's too cold to turn on the fan...  
🌊 There's a caterpillar under my eye...

..?  
🐛  
It's my pet caterpillar  
The Samsung cheer song is fun too  
Today,  
I saw an interview  
Wow  
I thought it was a home run  
I was so surprised  
The lion is so scary  
They're so strong...  
Does anyone  
have a country they want to visit?  
Everyone’s got different ideas  
For me,  
I just like being at home...  
Planes are tough these days  
When I was 9,  
I used to look at the stars at night,  
but these days it’s hard  
*sobs*  
I found a picture of me with Hoyeon  
But I’m not giving it to you hehe  
Keke  
Maybe if Kia wins one day, I'll send it... lol  
🌊 Is that a forever-never thing?

????..?.?.?.?.?  
\\?/
No, haha  
The reaction after sending that was hilarious ㅜㅜ lol  
I believe in Kia 😉😉

![[1729171697223.png|150]]  
Was it March?  
Or April?  
For now, instead of the Hoyeon pic, here's this~~  
🌊 Do you have more pictures from that internal dance event??

I don't have any...  
Maybe I do?  
I’ll look for them someday…  
Wow, it’s already the bottom of the 4th inning  
Ahhh  
Austin player…  
I’m not cheering for anyone...  
But  
I hope LG makes it through…  
Samsung is scary...  
Scary ><  
No seriously…  
So scary...  
Their defense, offense,  
everything is flawless  
They’re like machines...  
Terrifying... 😔😔😔  
Ahhh  
I don't think I can watch the Korea Series  
I’ll either get super stressed or super excited...  
Hurry up and bring the regular season already...  
Even the national team is nerve-wracking  
Hahaha  
But at least for now I can chill and sing other teams' cheer songs  
I'm thinking about getting the home uniform for the national team, hehe  
The more I look at it, the more I like the home version  
Marking,  
I'm debating on it  
Maybe...?  
Kim Do-young player, I think  
Kia's been releasing a ton of merch lately...  
Today, Yang Hyun-jong's uniform came out too...  
Ahhh, I hope the regular season comes soon  
Even though it’s the Korea Series, it feels like a Monday on a Thursday since our team’s not playing  
Samsung’s cheer songs are so fun...  
VM  
VM  
The hexagon appears  
No lol  
It's Soomin unnie  
Waaaah  
Baseball ends so quickly  
🌊 Have you ever thought about playing baseball yourself, Haerin??

I think I’d be terrible at it...  
Lol  
If I get the chance...  
But  
If I start liking volleyball too, I’ll go bankrupt...  
I've already spent so much on baseball...  
Oh  
A sacrifice hit!!  
I’m gonna do a "bankruptcy ping"  
Lol  
“Bankruptcy ping” sounds cute  
Oh  
Happy birthday  
Keke  
Out of today's pictures or videos,  
tell me which one you liked the most  
I’ll try to find something like that  
No, lol  
Don't choose Samsung's cheer song ㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
What the heck  
Everyone likes my blurry sentimental vibe  
"Just Your Presence" - Wonstein sunbaenim  
Watching the first episode of *2521*,  
I suddenly remembered  
Ah,  
that feeling from last year  
It came back  
As soon as I saw it,  
I remembered,  
and watched some old videos from last year's academy...  
ㅎ
Here’s the translation:

Heyyy  
I bombed my exam  
Hehe  
![[1729171682796.mp4]]  
Gift  
You know, we all have those days…  
When you suddenly want to turn on the fan in the middle of the night and record a video…  
🌊 I think my mole is getting darker and darker, hahaha, do you think so? 🫶

It’s always been my mole…  
🌊 Ma Jeong Haerin, you're addicted to Kia Tigers!!!!!

Sorry,  
I’m watching baseball right now  
No hahaha  
That video  
Isn't recent haha  
It’s from last month  
These days,  
It’s too cold  
To turn on the fan..

🌊 There’s a caterpillar under your eyes…

..?  
🐛  
It's my pet caterpillar  
Singing along to the Samsung cheer song is fun too  
Today  
I saw an interview  
Wow  
I thought it was a home run  
Scared me  
Lions are so scary  
They’re super strong…  
Everyone,  
Is there a country you want to visit?  
So many different answers  
For me,  
I just like being home…  
Flying has been hard lately  
When I was 9,  
I used to look at the stars at night,  
But now it’s tiring  
Sniff sniff  
I found a picture I took with Hoyeon  
But I’m not giving it to you lol  
Hehe  
Someday, when Kia wins, I’ll send it… haha  
🌊 Is this something I’ll never get to see in my lifetime?

????..?.?.?.?.?  
\\?/

No haha  
Sending that pic and your reaction was too funny haha  
I trust Kia  
😉😉  
![[1729171692436.png|150]]  
![[1729171697223.png|150]]  
Was it March or  
April?  
Instead of the picture with Hoyeon, here's this for now ~  
🌊 Do you have more photos from the “inner dance” moment?

No…  
Maybe I do,  
I'll look for it someday…  
Wow, it’s already the bottom of the 4th inning  
Ahhh  
Austin… player  
I'm not cheering for anyone…  
But,  
I hope LG advances…  
Samsung is scary…  
Too scary ><  
No…  
Really too scary…  
Defense, offense,  
There’s no weak spot  
Feels like a beast..  
Too scary… 😔😔😔  
Ahh  
I don’t think I can watch the Korean Series  
I'll either get too stressed or be super happy…  
I just want the regular season to come quickly…  
I'm nervous about the national team too  
Hahaha  
At least I can cheer for another team with a peaceful heart  
I'm thinking of getting the national team uniform’s home version hehe  
For some reason, I like the home version better  
The markings,  
I'm debating…  
Maybe…?  
Maybe I'll choose Kim Doyoung  
Kia's been releasing a lot of goods lately…  
Today, Yang Hyeonjong’s jersey came out too…  
Ahhh hurry,  
I wish the regular season would come  
Even during the Korean Series, without our team’s games,  
Thursdays feel like Mondays  
Samsung’s cheer songs are pretty fun  
VM  
VM  
The hexagon appears  
Haha  
It's Soomin unnie  
Aww  
Baseball ends way too fast  
🌊 Haerin, have you ever thought about playing baseball yourself?

I think I’d suck…  
Hahaha  
If I get the chance…  
If I also start liking volleyball,  
I’ll go bankrupt…  
I’ve already spent too much on baseball…  
Oh  
Sacrifice bunt!!  
I’m going bankrupt-ping  
Hahaha  
Bankrupt-ping is kinda cute  
Oh  
Happy birthday  
Haha  
From today’s  
Photos or videos, tell me which one you liked the most  
I'll try to find something with a similar vibe  
No hahaha  
Don’t pick a Samsung cheer song hahaha  
What is this  
Everyone seems to like my gloomy vibes  
"Just by Existing" - Wonstein sunbaenim  
2521  
I remembered it while watching the first episode  
Sigh  
Last year’s  
Emotions came back  
As soon as I saw it  
I thought of it  
For the first time in a while,  
I even watched videos from last year's academy days..

I found the picture I took back then too  
Hehe  
Nope, you greedy ones  
Not happening lol  
Someday…  
🌊 Does Soeah plan study time?

Now that exams are over…  
Nope  
I used to do it when I had time  
Will LG win today?  
I hope player Koo Ja-wook’s injury isn’t serious ㅜㅜ  
Nooo, no injuries,  
Health is everything…  
Stay healthy  
[y/n]  
After becoming a fan,  
I get it now…  
You really need to experience things yourself to understand  
I can’t watch the game anymore  
My 🍎 iPad  
Battery is at 1%  
I don’t have a charger  
Only an iPhone charger  
🌊 So, you’re not watching on your phone?

I'm in Fromm,  
😏😏😏  
Giving up  
Giving up on baseball  
Haha  
Isn’t that amazing  
I’ve proven my true love at this point  
No hahaha  
During a Kia game,  
[Y/N] is even better  
Haha  
These days,  
All I hear is cheering  
I only listen to the same song over and over…  
Heeing  
I can’t do “Oh No Chu”..  
I’ll find it  
ISLAND - Winner sunbaenim  
Found it  
VM  
Haha  
What should I talk about now  
Ah, right  
Yesterday  
Did you see the super blue moon?  
I heard it was up  
But I didn’t see it…  
What did you have for dinner?  
I had gukbap🍚🍚🍚🍚🍚🍚  
I had spicy gukbap  
🌊 Binnie said she hasn’t tried gukbap yet, what do you think?

Huh?  
Last time,  
We went to Busan  
And for dinner, we had gukbap  
Did she not eat then? I don’t remember  
🌊 Soeah, when you eat gukbap, do you add a lot of spicy paste and kimchi cubes?? 💕💕

I add all the spicy paste  
But I don’t eat the kimchi cubes  
Usually,  
For ramen or seaweed soup,  
I just eat the broth and rice  
Ah  
I think I eat pickled radish when I have jajangmyeon  
🌊 Soeah, have you ever heard of dipping chicken feet in chojang (vinegar red pepper paste)? Chewonnie mentioned it on her live yesterday

What’s that  
I don’t know  
I only eat chojang with sundae or sashimi  
I don’t remember what chicken feet taste like..  
🌊 For tangsuyuk, are you team pour sauce or dip sauce???

I don’t mind  
It’s hard to find pour sauce fans these days  
Even if it’s served,  
I think I dip the sauce now,  
But I don’t really care  
TMI: Ha Yeon unnie is team dip  
🌊 Recommend me a snack~ 😻😻

Fried udon  
Eat it for me instead  
I’m too full  
Ah,  
Were you asking for a late-night snack recommendation  
🌊 Recommend a snack for watching baseball

Hmm  
Cream shrimp?  
No hahaha  
That’s late-night food hahaha  
😑😑😑😑😑  
Geez, really  
Honestly  
🌊 I heard the cream shrimp at Gocheok is super famous and delicious!

Oh  
Okay  
I’ll try it out someday  
Later,  
I want to take some of the members  
To the baseball stadium  
Hopefully next year..  
Among the members,  
Is there anyone who likes baseball?  
I don’t think so  
Some like soccer  
But I don’t know much about soccer..  
The first soccer game I remember  
Was in Ulsan  
If I end up liking soccer too,  
Ahh,  
I’ll be broke..  
I’d literally go bankrupt~  
Hahaha  
Is the national soccer team playing now?  
Oh, it’s the qualifiers  
I’m heading out now  
Goodnight in advance  
Bye  
You worked hard today too!
