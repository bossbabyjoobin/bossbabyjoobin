Today, I went to an aquarium with oppa  
and we did a lot of things
Recently, I’ve gotten a lot closer to him <sup>[They have a 10-year age gap btw]</sup>
It’s gotten so cold...  
It’s already October...  
I can't believe it
🌊 Hoodie vs Cardigan

Is there no long padding among the options... 
I'm going to wear a  long padding
I didn’t use to feel the cold before...
But now it’s so cold
Oh right
Today, the 5th place was determined <sup>[KT Wiz vs SSG Landers 5th place tiebreaker in KBO - KT won]</sup>
and a friend of mine is really happy since she’s a KT fan
Now the fall baseball season is starting..
I’m going to buy a jumper too... <sup>[jumper = windbreaker]</sup>
It’s so cold...  
I want to buy a Black Tiger jumper but I’m still thinking about it <sup>[Black tiger = KIA Tigers' windbreaker]</sup>  
I can’t escape baseball 🫠🫠🫠🫠  
크크 🥰🥰  
I love baseball so much 
I couldn’t get tickets...  
ㅠㅠ  
I have terrible luck 💩💩💩💩💩  
saedeu saedeu… <sup>[Literally "sad sad", It's just an expression]</sup>
크크 it’s okay  
Maybe my friend will manage to get them..?  
I’m going to buy a jersey
크크
Oh right, how's the objekt this time?  
I’m glad you thought it was pretty ㅎㅎ
I couldn’t buy it since I’m saving up.. 크크크 <sup>[She's saving up to buy baseball jerseys]</sup>

What’s everyone doing now?  
Is Black and White Chef trending these days?  <sup>[Black and White Chef: Culinary Class Wars, a must watch]</sup>
I haven’t seen it yet...  
I’ll watch it after the baseball season ends 
Sorry.. ㅋㅋㅋ
I still need to watch 2521 too
but I’m too caught up in baseball
so I haven’t rewatched it yet
🌊 Do you watch baseball replays?

I watch the highlights!!  
Since I missed one game, I watched it at the airport ㅋㅋㅋ
ShiOn unnie said "Let’s eat Dubai chocolate together after we’re done showering"  
I’ve finished washing up now 😆  
When I eat chocolate
I drink milk 
What do you guys drink?

Sleep well in advance
Bye bye
