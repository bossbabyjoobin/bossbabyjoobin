Hiiii 
🐯🐯🔥🔥🔥
Just finished showering ㅋㅋㅎㅎㅋ
I enjoyed watching it through a video, it was so fun <sup>[t/n: Game 5, KIA's the champ 4-1]</sup>  
Even a tough girl like me shed a few tears
Really, not only KIA players but all players, you worked so hard all season 🥹💕  
As for my pledge, I’ll bring it as soon as I can!
🌊Haerin’s pick for season MVP is?  

Kim Sun-bin 🥺🥺 fire fire  
Ahhh  
The man of fall baseball!  
"Ohnosong’s on a Southbound Train"  
VM  
Kim Soo-hee's classic - "Southbound Train"  
🌊What's your favorite Kia player’s cheer song, Haerin? Can you sing it?  

I can’t pick!  
I’ll go with Lee Chang-jin’s entrance song.  
As for cheer songs, can’t choose just one!  
I like them all… but  
ugh,  
just for today,  
I’ll let it slide…😉  
Do you know all the cheer song choreography, Haerin? I wanna see a random play dance! Got a favorite choreo?  

Of course I know them all.  
Favorite choreo?  
They're all good…  
I’ve just been singing “Southbound Train” on repeat...  
Ahh, it’s addictive.  
Gotta wait until next year...  
Ahh, can’t believe baseball season is over  
shock shock shock  
It’s alright—  
we’ve still got the national team.  
Haha  
Ahhh  
Players must be so exhausted,  
going right into practice…  
Alright, I’m off now.  
Sleep well,  
you worked hard today too tiger tiger
