The possessive side of SeoAh came out because of a WAV

#SeoAh #서아 #fromm
___
☀️ SooMin unnie said she wanted to film with SeoAh during the Bicycle Signal

How do you even know that?  
Are you cheating on me right now?!?!  

☀️ How far would you forgive a WAV for *cheating* with another idol? Watching their videos? Going to their concert? Attending a pre-recording?  

Go ahead, try it
Hmph  

`[23 minutes later...]`  

☀️ Just got back from Yoasobi concert  

What?!  
Their MMA stage was amazing
.. but cheating is still cheating
Hmph
