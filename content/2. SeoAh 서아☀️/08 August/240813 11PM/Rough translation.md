뭐해
나도 지금 가구 있엉
오늘 정신이 없었다 ㅜㅜ
미아내
근데 시원했어 !
그리구 내가 이런 말 하기는 뭐하지만
우리 찍어주는것도 너무 고맙고 또 고마운데
우리 보러오신 다른 분들도 계시니까
앞으로는 같이 재밌게 보자 !
아무래도 우리 팬이니까
나한테 피해주는건 괜찮은데
다른 시민분들께 피해 주면 안되니까 
키키
잘못하면
나 무대 못 올라갈뻔 했다구 ㅋㅋ
10시 넘으면 못 올라가 ㅋㅋㅋ
크크크
우리
멤버들 반 이상이 못 올라가지 않나
ㅋㅋㅋ
괜차나
그래도 잘 마무리 했으니까

What are you doing? 
I'm on my way (home) right now too
Today was so hectic ㅜㅜ  
I'm sorry
But it was cool!  
And I feel a bit awkward saying this but
I'm really grateful that you always take pictures of us 
but there are other people who come to see us too
so let's all have fun together in the future!  
Since you're our fan 
I'm okay with you affecting me but  
we shouldn't inconvenience other people!  
If things had gone wrong 
I might not have been able to get on stage ㅋㅋ
You can't get on after 10 PM ㅋㅋㅋ <sup>[t/n: minors are not allowed to work between 10 PM and 6 AM]</sup>
크크크
I think more than half of our members wouldn't have been able to perform, right? <sup>[t/n: 8 (Sullin, 07s and maknaez)]</sup>
ㅋㅋㅋ
It's okay  
We wrapped things up well anyway
