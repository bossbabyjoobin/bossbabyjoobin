SeoAh talked about the special stage and a lil bit of TMI about waiting time in ISAC

#SeoAh #서아




Hi there  
How was your day?  
키키
They said I looked like Teenieping...
Today’s hairstyle was recommended by our hair stylist
ㅎㅎ  
🌊 How did you end up doing the Sailor Moon pose? <sup>[t/n: for the ending fairy]</sup>

It was the hair stylist’s suggestion…
키키
Today's fanchant was amazing 
I was a bit worried because there wasn’t one <sup>[t/n: no official fanchant but idk if MODHAUS gave WAVs a copy of the fanchant onsite or something]</sup>
but it turned out to be really well-thought-out ㅎㅎ  
Today's TMI is ISAC felt like a taekwondo match
Taekwondo matches also involve waiting for 4-5 hours
키키
What was everyone else doing?  
Oh and there are only 100 days left until the college entrance exam
Time flies…  
Fighting!  
By the way, did you eat today’s recommended meal or not?  
It was recommended during the pre-recording ㅎㅎ  
Unnie told us to eat gopdoritang<sup>[t/n: it's spicy braised chicken stew with small beef or pork intestines]</sup>
She told everyone to eat it for dinner
Today's song recommendation is
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together<sup>[EN]</sup>
Today, should I send a selfie or not? ㅋ  
![[GUS_SpBbEAAMb58.jpg|250]]
I’ll post the rest in the official SNS ㅋ  
Look forward to it
Wait for a bit for the ISAC one ㅎㅎ  
You greedy bunch
I’m going now  
키키 
Good night in advance  
and thank you so much for today!
