Heyyyy  
The weather’s nice today, huh?  
I thought of you and decided to drop by.  
What’s everyone up to?  
Have you had lunch yet?  
Since the weather’s so good,  
make sure you go out for a walk.  
Don’t just stay at home, haha.  
Time is precious, so don’t just stay inside—  
go out, take in the scenery,  
and you’ll have good memories to look back on, haha.  
Hehe.  
Spend lots of time with the people around you,  
and with me too.  
As for me,  
I’m back to school tomorrow 😔  
😑😑😑  
😞  
Sigh.  
*Christmas Tree*  
Oh no, V sunbaenim’s song.  
It’s not winter yet though? Lol.  
Going back to school and  
meeting friends is fun,  
but studying and the commute are hard...  
But still, when I’m at school,  
I’m not an idol—I’m just a student, lol.  
It’s fun.  
Maybe it’s because I like doing different things,  
but I like history the most.  
I like PE too.  
Haha.  
🌊 Is there anything you’re looking forward to doing after school starts?

I’m looking forward to PE with my friends, haha.  
History, too.  
Hmm.  
I like it all.  
But,  
I haven’t learned much world history yet 😔  
When I was in 5th grade,  
I studied Korean history for the first time,  
and I enjoyed it so much that I took detailed notes.  
I even attended history academies, hehe.  
Last year,  
I stayed after school to take extra classes,  
and we studied Korean history there.  
Keke.  
Is everyone here a science major or a liberal arts major?  
🌊 Science.

Lol, wait,  
typo.  
…  
But yeah,  
no misunderstandings, okay?  
I’m a liberal arts major.  
Science makes my head hurt…  
Even my mom was a science major…  
Keke.  
I really want to exercise soon.  
Keke.  
I’m ready for PE. Watch out, here I come!!  
🌊 Let’s aim for an A in PE, SeoA!

I usually get an A,  
but since I couldn’t participate much this time,  
I got a B 😭😭😭😭😭  
🌊 SeoA, did your PE test results come out yet?

I haven’t done it yet,  
but last year, I scored high on everything  
except for flexibility.  
🌊 How many shuttle runs can you do, SeoA❤️?

How many was it?  
I think I did over 80.  
I used to exercise back then,  
so my stamina was good...  
That was my prime...✨  
LOL.  
Oh, right!  
These days,  
I’m thinking about getting a bob cut.  
I’ve got bob fever...  
I had a bob cut before,  
like a year ago, haha.  
My hair feels heavy these days, lol.  
But then again,  
it’s almost winter, so lol,  
I’m not sure...  
Anyway, I’m gonna head out now.  
Bye, haha.  
Sleep well in advance,  
and have a great day!
