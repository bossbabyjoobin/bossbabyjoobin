Hiiii 
I’m in the vocal room
Earlier, I was dancing, then I ate 
and now I’m here in the vocal room  
Gukbap ㅎㅎ  
Spicy gukbap..  <sup>[t/n: lit. soup and rice]</sup>
☀️ Haerin-ah, I want to binge a drama. Any recommendations? ㅠ

Family by Choice  
A drama that heals your tired mind from the exhaustion of daily life
Good good 
Today's song rec
JAESSBEE - Every Moment With You
This song is good
I heard Gravity opened up  
Daebak
I’m curious about  *Door* OT24 performance ㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It would be cool to rearrange it  
For an OT24 performance, I also thought about *Cherry Talk* but  
hmm…  
it might feel a bit scary  
48 hands...  
I'm not sure about that
☀️ SeoAh, what’s your favorite tripleS song?

I don’t listen to K-pop…  
🙄🙄  
ㅎㅎ  
`[Fun fact: Binnie and SeoAh don't listen to K-pop much. They usually recommend pop songs, and SeoAh often recommend Drama OSTs.]`
It’s been a while since I last listened to K-pop
Love Soseol is nice
I think I first heard it as a demo?
It was good 
_Aria_ is more my style
I don’t usually listen to K-pop in general…
ㅎㅎ  
Mostly pop songs or  
ballads..?  
Japanese songs too  
☀️ If there’s another Ballad Dimension, would you want to join? I’d love to hear more of your singing! 🥺

I think I’d like to  
For me, songs have always been there to comfort me when I was struggling and to bring me joy when I was happy
So, I want to use my voice to comfort others and share that joy
I want to be a source of strength for people?  
I’ve loved singing since I was young
ㅎㅎ  
But my vocal range is a bit low
so that’s a little disappointing…
With practice, I’ll get there someday
ㅎㅎ  
I’m still recovering from a cold 
so please understand
`[VM: Please please ~]`

ㅋㅋ  
Yesterday’s Signal was so fun
ㅋㅋ  
I’m going to step out for a moment 
Wait for me 

`[45 minutes later...]`

Sorry  
I’m so late  
What were you doing?  
Ahh but I have to go now… 🥺🥺  
I’m sorry…  
I’ve been like this since yesterday 🥺🥺  <sup>[t/n: gtg all of a sudden]</sup>
Cheer up for today too  
Bye!  
I’ll be back tomorrow!!
