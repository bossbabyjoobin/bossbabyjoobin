Merry Christmas everyone!!
Did you all have a great day today?
I had a great day too  
I spent so much time thinking about this letter 
that the day just flew by  
But since it’s a once-a-year kind of day
I hope you all spent it happily
❤️🎄🎅

Here's a gift 🎁 
The rest will be uploaded on the official account
❤️❤️
Come to think of it, this is our first Christmas together  
That's really nice

This was taken today
ㅎㅎ
I hung out with my friends today
We had meringue cookies and watched a movie
"Even If This Love Disappears from the World Tonight" <sup>[2022, JP movie]</sup>
It’s my all-time favorite movie

I saw this while passing by and it was too cute not to take a pic ㅎㅎ  
I’ll post more pictures from today on the official account later ㅎㅎ
I did my makeup all by myself today
and took a lot of pictures with my 6s hehe
Now that I’ve switched to iPhone 16 <sup>[t/n: Her mom bought it for her]</sup>
I can’t see the iPhone 12 vibe anymore ㅜ 
I got attached to it, so I feel a bit sad… 😔  
Hihi
Rudolph SeoAh is going to sleep now…  
Sleep well
You worked hard today too  
Love you 🤍
