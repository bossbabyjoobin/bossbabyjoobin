#SeoAh #서아

Hiii 
What are you doing?   
I messed up my exam
ㅎㅎ  
I’ll do better next time…  
Still, it was nice being with my classmates  
ㅎㅎ  
After the test, they were like “The test’s over!”
and went out to hang out ㅋㅋ  
I couldn’t go though
Well, maybe we’ll meet up later when we’re all free ㅋㅋ  
We’ll see each other someday, right?  
ㅎㅎ  
We’re seeing each other tomorrow too  
It’d be so nice if I could see [Y/N] every day  
Ahhh  
It’s so cold
As expected, it's winter  
Even my phone battery is down to 14%!!!!
But (I'm doing fromm) for [Y/N] 
크크
☀️ SeoAh, are you watching any dramas these days?

Nope ㅠ  
Nothing’s really catching my attention
I want to rewatch _2521_
but I haven’t managed to start yet
The MMA 4-cut came out today  
How was it?  
`[Not sent in the chat.]`

Looking at the 4-cut, I had this thought
*“Wait, am I the only one giving off a puppy vibe…?”*  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
The unnies: 😎🐱  
Me: 🎀🐶  
I’ll just give up on being cool 
Sorry
My battery is dying ㅜㅜ
I’ll be going now 🥺🥺  
Sorry, I’ll definitely be back tomorrow
Sleep well in advance
and good job today
