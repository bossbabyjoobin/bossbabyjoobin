Emotional SeoAh makes an appearance before the day ends

#SeoAh #서아

Hi  
What are you doing? 
The weather's been so cold lately...  
This morning, on my way to school
It was so cold
Scarf, long padding and hot packs are absolute essentials
Finally, it’s Friday 
Hehe  
I should go to bed early tonight
When will I ever watch Moana... ㅜ  
Looking for [Y/N] to go watch it with me  
크크
It’s kind of fascinating to see your breath in the cold
The stars are really visible tonight
It's like a constellation
I never realize there were so many
I guess I haven't taken the time to really look at the sky in a while
Not much? Not at all?
When you just glance up, you don't really notice
But when you take a closer look 
There are so many 
You can even spot planes
It feels like I’m noticing things today  
that I normally wouldn’t
☀️ Today, Haerin is in an emotional mode

That's right ㅋㅋ
I’m going to eat sweet potatoes again today
크크  
They're so good 
Even people who don’t like sweet potatoes admit they're tasty
크크  
I'm off to eat some now
ㅎㅎ  
Sleep well in advance 
You worked hard today too
