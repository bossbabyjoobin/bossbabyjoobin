Sunshine Squad~~
It's already been 100 days since we started From? ㅋㅋ
Time really flies, doesn't it..
It's still amazing to me
From before debut until now
I remember every single thing, and now it's already 100 days..
Time sure flies, right?
Thank you for filling these 100 days with love
Thank you so much for coming to From every time
And for always talking with me even though you're busy
And I think a lot of things happened in these 100 days
From music shows to getting 1st place.. internal dances, and so on
There were so many gifts for me that it's hard to express in words
I'll also give gifts to Sunshine Squad from now on ㅋㅋ💓
Thank you and thank you again

17 minutes until the end of From's 100 days ㅋ
Kiki
So, to commemorate
I'll send a photo during my public video ㅋ
I only took one back then
It's the only one

Kik, is it pretty? Are you smitten? Keke
And there's one from the music show too

It was so hot after the pre-recording
It was the same day as the puffed rice photo
Same lens too, you fools
Just the difference in lighting..✨
Today's selfies end here
Gotta keep a little distance ~😏💓

What did everyone have for dinner?
I had 🚊
Subway..
Oh right
🌊 Let me tell you Seoa's Subway pick!

Shrimp 15
Wheat
Only lettuce
Sweet chili
That's it
Oh, and
These days
`Baskin Robbins`
I think my favorite is changing
I like cheesecake
🚊 Can we also see Seoa's tone next to Sohyun unnie?

I wonder ㅋ
My aegyo is
..
Unhearable ㅋ

I'm going to sleep now ㅋ
Goodnight everyone
Thanks
Bye bye
