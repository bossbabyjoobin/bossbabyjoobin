SeoAh drops by before heading out for dinner in Montreal

#SeoAh #서아 #fromm

Good morning 😉  
It’s nighttime over here ☺️☺️  
It’s 6:30 PM  
Since I’m in Montreal, there’s a lot of snow ❄️❄️  
It’s cold.. 🥶  
It must be cold in Korea too
Be careful not to catch a cold
☀️ Did you check the time in Korea before chatting on fromm?

I always check the time on the weather app

And this one’s from Bangkok 
ㅎㅎ
I’m about to have dinner soon!
Right now, I’m listening to 2002(acoustic) <sup>[t/n: By Anne-Marie]</sup>

Lately, I find headsets more comfortable than AirPods
The one I use is lightweight ! 
so it’s comfy even when I wear it around my neck
Did you see the shorts I filmed with JooBin unnie?  
Our styles were completely different…
Even while filming the shorts, we said that our outfits were so differentㅋㅋ
My mom didn’t even recognize me at first
She sees me often but my face was covered ㅋㅋㅋ
The sunset was really beautiful 
I wanna see it again
