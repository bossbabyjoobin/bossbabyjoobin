Hello!  
Stopping by before getting on the plane
It’s morning here
Yesterday’s concept was a cat

The styling was totally something I’ve been wanting to try for a while ㅎㅎㅎ
Tomie? Vibes? ㅋㅋㅋ

Is this one a bunny?  
I’ve been experimenting with different styles on tour
The cat concept was my idea ㅎㅎ
Today's song rec!

Gotta board soon ㅠㅜ
Even in Korea, I wanna do the cat concept

I’m off now  
Good night and great job today !
