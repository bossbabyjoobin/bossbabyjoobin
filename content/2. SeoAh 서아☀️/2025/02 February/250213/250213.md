tripleS members had nightmares and experienced strange occurrences in their hotel rooms

Oh right, I had nightmares yesterday and the day before!! 🫢🫢  
I don’t usually dream, so it was weird..
There was a painting right in front of my hotel bed, and it was kind of scary
It was a forest? Blurry and blue 
It's just strange..
I still vividly remember the dream I had on the first night!!! 
🫢🫢🫢🫢
After the concert, HaYeon unnie came to our room for a bit
We were just watching YouTube and stuff
Then she left because she was tired
But what happened there was super creepy too
While HaYeon unnie was showering, NaKyoung unnie called her from outside
or at least, that’s what she thought
But NaKyoung unnie said she never called her
And apparently, the same thing happened when NaKyoung unnie was showering too
I normally don’t dream either…  
But on the first night, when I was sleeping 
I was struggling a lot in my sleep
And that’s never happened to me before.. 🥺
DaHyun unnie also had nightmares, it was really scary
🤔🤔
That room felt eerie…  
And for some reason, ours was the only one that was unusually cold
like there was this strange chill in the air
Even HaYeon unnie noticed it when she came in
She said our room felt gloomier and colder than the others
Even though her room was right next to ours…
Should we sprinkle some salt? ㅋㅋㅋ
But seriously, the painting was so weird
I even took a picture
Hmm
Nah, never mind
I’ll just keep it to myself
There were so many trees, all navy blue
and when the lights were off
they almost looked like people?
But it didn’t exactly feel like a forest either...
Even though all the hotel rooms were dark
ours felt especially eerie🤔🤔
