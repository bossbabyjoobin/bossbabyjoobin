Hi !! ㅎㅎ  
I’m a bit late but the North American tour is already over 🥺
To be honest, I had some worries when we first started preparing for the tour, but now that it’s over, I realize just how meaningful this experience was for me. At first, things like living abroad and the language barrier felt overwhelming but as time passed, I found myself completely drawn to North America's charm ㅋㅋ When it was almost time to return to Korea, I even wished I could stay a little longer and explore more. That’s how much this tour meant to me. Thanks to it, I got to meet so many precious people and create countless happy memories, so I'm truly grateful 🤍 Traveling from city to city, meeting WAVs, seeing different landscapes and experiencing new cultures made this such a joyful and fulfilling experience for me

And to everyone who waited while I was away, thank you so so much 🤍 Our concert in Korea is coming up soon, so let’s meet then!! I’ll work hard to put on an even better performance. Thank you and I love you WAVs
