SeoAh gets a call from a member just as she’s about to go to bed but why?

☀️ I heard the heartwarming story about you being a Bug Hunter 🐞

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I can'tㅜㅜ ㅋㅋㅋ  
No like ㅜㅜ  
Yesterday, I was like *I’ll read a book and head to bed~*
Turned off my phone, laid down
and literally one second later, I got a call 
<font color="#c9a3e0">“🎀 SeoAh-ya ㅜㅜㅜㅜ"  </font>
<font color="#c9a3e0">"🎀 Can you come over to our HAUS...”  </font>
So when I heard there was a bug
I thought it’d be something serious like a cockroach or something
but then it turned out to be a ladybug...

It was Chaewon unnie who called me ㅋㅋㅜㅜㅜ  
So I just caught it and went straight back to bed
