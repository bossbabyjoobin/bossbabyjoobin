SeoAh’s letter on her reveal anniversary

#SeoAh #서아 #fromm

Hi! Today marks one year since HaeRin was introduced to WAV!! I can’t believe it’s already been a year since we’ve been together…
Haven’t I grown a lot over the past year? ㅋㅋ

In just one year, I’ve performed on music shows, held concerts and gone on tour. So much has happened and it has made me realize how fast time flies. For me, 2024 was a year full of new experiences and everything felt so new. It made me happy to be loved and to meet people I love. Thanks to that I think I’ve also learned how to give love

When I attended the year-end awards show that I had only ever seen on TV, I was so happy that I couldn’t even put it into words. But being able to be there and stand on that stage was all because of WAV. WAV has given me unforgettable experiences and taught me the meaning of love...

You are so precious to me. With our comeback just around the corner, I find myself missing you more and more. We recently wrapped up our overseas tour and every single moment made me so happy. Each time, I realize just how cherished and loved I am and I want WAVs to feel the same way too. I’m truly grateful and I love you. Let’s keep being together from here on out
