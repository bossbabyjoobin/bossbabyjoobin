I'll be taking my graduation photos soon
Originally, I wanted to dress up as Vanellope
but I'm matching concepts with my friends
so we decided to go with a Y2K look instead
I'll show you my fashion sense
ㅋㅋㅋ  
크크
I can't believe  
I'm already graduating!!  
☀️ Are all the members coming?

🫢  
That's... a lot...  
Hihi
It would be so nice if they could come
💓  
I'll be looking forward to it, unnies~~ !! 🤍😽
