Hi ㅎㅎ  
🤍🤍  
I wonder if the people who came to the opening ceremony are eating right now?  
It’s raining, so be careful

Today was so much fun 
Today's song recommendation is ICU — aespa sunbaenim  ~
Wow, it’s been such a long time since I last recommended a song
Sorry ㅜㅜ  
I haven’t been feeling well lately, so I couldn’t come on fromm
But I’m doing okay now
ㅎㅎ  
It’s really nice to see you again after a while
Our comeback date got announced
Daebak
I didn’t know it was going to be revealed today
Exactly one month from now
Also, how was the _Black Soul Dress_ choreography today?
Hehe  
I’m glad you liked it  
Alright then, I’ll get going now.. 🥺  
Sleep well in advance  
You worked hard today too
