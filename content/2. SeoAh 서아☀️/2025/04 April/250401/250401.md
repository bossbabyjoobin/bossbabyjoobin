Binnie’s here!  
ㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱ
What are you doing?  
I just ate
Did you have lunch?
SeoAh keeps coming to our room to bother me…
☀️ She’s still a baby… JooBin, be the mature unnie and let it slide~

Right, she’s still a baby 
so I should be understanding...  
😚😚  
SeoAh is a baby
🫧 She’s been really into hugs lately, so make sure to hug her~

She keeps coming to our room all the time…  
I should put a “No Entry” sign on our door  
And every time, she talks about some green character? like Hangyodon  
I can’t stop her
🫧 You mean Kuchipatchi? The one from Tamagotchi?

Oh!! That’s the one!
But…  
I still can’t believe the tour is over…  
But we’ll see each other again next week <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: fan meeting]</font></sup>
😚😚
I’m going now
ㅎㅎ  
I’ll be back tonight
