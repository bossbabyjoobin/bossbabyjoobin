Meet Leny the Caterpillar

#SeoAh #서아 #fromm

Wow  
There's a caterpillar in my hands
I thought it was a twig 
but it’s alive!  
It’s tiny  
So cute  
Should I take it back to the dorm and raise it?

What if it’s poisonous or something?  
But I already touched it  
Still, it’s cute  
It’s walking around with its little legs
It’s so cute

Let me introduce you  
I looked at it up close and it’s _so_ cute

애니

I released Leny<font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[래니]</sup></font> back into nature  
Everything earlier was all auto-correct mistakes ㅠ  
I’ve gotten attached
but for that little one’s freedom... 
But the place where Lenny was 
was kind of yellowish  
Maybe 💩?
