The reason why SeoAh cried 

#SeoAh #서아 #fromm
___

Did you enjoy today's concert?  
I know I was lacking in many ways
but thank you so much for seeing me in a positive light
ㅎㅎ  
I cried in front of my friends for the first time today
I always acted like I was fine
but before I knew it, the tears just came out ㅋㅋ
I don’t usually say things like this but
my friend gave me a gift and said
"Let’s only walk on a flowery path. I'll always support you" ㅋㅋ  
<font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[t/n: SeoAh's friend is wishing for only good things to happen to her]</sup></font>
They also said I looked happy on stage and hoped I'd always be that way
Honestly, both my friend and I aren’t the type to express our feelings
We just tease each other all the time
Maybe that's why I teared up even more  
크크
We have another concert tomorrow
Anyone coming?  
I'm looking forward to it
Oh and today...  
I didn't see any aliens ㅜ  
Was everyone... too embarrassed? 🥺🥺👽👽

Okay, got it...
How was the crowd interaction?  
Let's be even louder tomorrow~~
☀️ Can you find Haetsaldan in the audience?

<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[She's the ☀️ and her fans are sunlight ^~^]</font></sup>

If you have a sign, I should be able to find you
Hehe  
Name boards?  
Those make it easy to spot you
I'll do my best to shout "make some noise" again tomorrow
ദ്ദി・ᴗ・)✧
I wish tomorrow would come faster
I miss you
Tomorrow, I’ll go for a cute look
Since today was all about being pretty
ㅎㅎ
I’m going now  
Sleep well in advance  
You worked hard today too
