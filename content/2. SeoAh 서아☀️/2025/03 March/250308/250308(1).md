Tada!  
☀️ You’ve got such a good sense of style

Hehe  
Lately, I’ve been really into fashion
so I keep asking my brother for advice
He’s basically my stylist now 
I check with him every time
I think I mostly wear black, blue and khaki?

And this, It's from the day of the tour live
Actually, that day…  
I had freckles on
ㅎㅎ  
Just as a little experiment?  
I’m thinking of trying it again later
