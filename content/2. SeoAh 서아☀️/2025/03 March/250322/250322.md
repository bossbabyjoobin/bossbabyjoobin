What are you doing?  
I just got back from practice
I didn’t get to watch baseball today ㅜ
Not even for a bit…
Just living my life and working hard
Hehe 
😚😚
My pictures got uploaded today 
What do you think? 
크크
I’m sorting through my photos now...
I’ll post some old ones too
Next month marks my 1st reveal anniversary ㅎㅎ
It still doesn’t feel real...
☀️ Binnie said she’s filming a reels with you? ㅋㅋㅋ

Yup, I already planned everything
But that’s a secret 
It wouldn’t be fun if you knew in advance
I thought about doing one with Nien unnie, Xinyu unnie, HaYeon unnie, etc
but never got around to it ㅎㅎ
Once music show promotions start, we’ll be filming a lot anyway
ㅎㅎ
As for my favorite part in _Stranger Things_…
Hmm… 
Me <sup>[EN]</sup> 
HaYeon unnie’s part is really nice too
I like how the vibe shifts there
Today's song recommendation
Getting Closer – SEVENTEEN sunbaenim  
Lately, I feel like I’ve been acting cuter...
I’ve also been more affectionate with my family
Every time I see them, I’m like “Give Haerin a Hug~” 
ㅎㅎ.. 
😅😅
When I’m with my family, I talk in third person using my real name ㅋㅋㅋ
Like “Haerin needs to do this” ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
`[VM: Give Haerin a Hug]`

…I should run away now…  
So embarrassing
I always end up getting hugged
ㅎㅎ
☀️ Who could possibly resist that? ㅋㅋ

My aunt is a tsundere, so she avoids it...
Hehe
Alright, back to being *grown-up* SeoAh now
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
No more acting cute…  
ㅎㅎ..
I’ll get going now~  
Byee
You worked hard today too 
Good night
