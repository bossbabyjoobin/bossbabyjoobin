You’re probably asleep, right?  
I got back to the dorm and took a shower 
I suddenly thought of you, so I came

Here’s a gift
 💝💝
I’ve been using the headset well
I had to listen to music ㅎㅎ
I can’t live without it!! Hihi
Today’s song recommendation  
Very, Slowly – BIBI sunbaenim <sup>[t/n: One of 2521 OSTs, her favorite drama]</sup>
☀️ Would you rather never listen to music again vs never drink beverages again?

I’d give up drinks
And you’d have to go a long time without them, you know
Oh... Ah... Eh...  
Ugh 😢
Well, anyway...
I wanna see you for a long time
But why is everyone still awake?  
You must be tired ㅜ 
I have to go to school too… 🫠🫠
Hing
Let’s go to school together...  
Wake me up...  
I'll find people to go to school with
Hehe
I need to dry my hair
크크
☀️ I just remembered a Shorts about using your phone while drying your hair

Heol, that’s interesting
I always watch YouTube or movies?
Anyway, I’m going to sleep now
Sleep well
Hwaiting for work, for school and even sleeping
You did well today too 💛
