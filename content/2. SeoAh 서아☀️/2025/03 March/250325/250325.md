SeoAh’s late-night thoughts on her way back to the HAUS

Are you still awake…?
[Y/N] are you asleep?  
I'm on my way back to the HAUS now  
Passing by the Han River, it's so pretty
I came because I missed you
I suddenly realized that the love I receive isn't something to take for granted, so I want to put in just as much effort... 
ㅎㅎ
Thank you
I’m feeling emotional
The temperature's been fluctuating a lot lately
so dress warmly and be careful not to catch a cold
Today's song recommendation~~
Forever Has Always Been – Redoor-nim
I hope summer comes soon
Early summer!
The weather is nice and cool… 
I want to go to the Han River when I have time
I’d love to have a picnic
ㅋㅋ  
Let's go together
I'll make the lunchbox
I just arrived at the HAUS 
Good night
You worked hard today too
