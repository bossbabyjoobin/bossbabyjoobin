#SeoAh #서아

☀️ Let me recommend you a song ~ I should’ve done it when you were passing by the Han River the other day. *To Reach You – 10cm*

Waaah  
10cm sunbaenim's voice tone is so nice..  
I’m trying to find my vocal style
but it's really hard..
☀️ Do you have a role model as a vocalist?

Hmm..  
Taeyeon sunbaenim  
IU sunbaenim  
10cm sunbaenim  
Minnie sunbaenim  
SuHyun sunbaenim <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: AKMU]</font></sup>
☀️ Is your goal to write and compose songs too?!

Yup !  
But before that, I want to improve my vocal skills first, then learn how to write and compose after that
Hehe
It's one of my goals..!  
Hwaiting!

I’ve been trying out songwriting little by little
but I still don’t really get it ㅠㅠ  
I like writing, so I do it from time to time but it’s still hard..
