SeoAh can't wait to meet WAVs but is too lazy to pack 

#SeoAh #서아 #fromm

What are you doing?  
I was stretching  
I need to pack but it's so hard ㅜ  
I really want to meet WAVs soon
I mean, I always miss you  
but these days, I feel like I miss you even more 
ㅎㅎ 
During the promotion period, I think I unconsciously took it for granted (meeting WAVs)
I thought it was just natural
But now that I think about it, maybe it’s not
That’s probably why I miss you even more
I just wanted to thank WAVsㅎㅎ

I ordered a showerhead filter with rocket delivery <sup>[next-day delivery]</sup>
ㅎㅎ
I ordered it yesterday, just in case…  
There was a time when there were issues with the water, so I’m a little worried
<sup>[t/n: maybe allergies? due to sudden change of the water quality]</sup>

☀️ Tomorrow's my graduation and I'm going to stick a picture of Haerin in the bouquet!

Wow..  
Congratulations on your graduation😆😆  
I'm graduating soon to 
The predicted temperature for today is -16°C
Dress warmly
It was so cold when I left work yesterday…  
So cold…  
A girl from Gwangju can’t handle this…  
[Y/N], hug me…  
Hihi
What did you eat for lunch?  
I had Subway too
ㅋㅋ  
I need some Korean food for dinner
Ahh, it’s so cold
Even just opening the window a bit
It's chilling
ㅋㅋ  
I still need to pack but I’m feeling so lazy…
At this rate, I’ll probably end up scrambling late at night
Anyway, I’m going now
Today's song recommendation
peach eyes - wave to earth-nim 
Cheer up today
Love you
