#SeoAh #서아

___
Happy New Year 🤍😆🎉  
Happy New Year 🍀<sup>[CN]</sup>
Happy New Year 🍀<sup>[JP]</sup>
How’s everyone doing?  
I had rice cake soup
Did everyone have some New Year’s food??
Lately, I’ve been playing a game with the tour unnies
It's Sue game
Huh? You don't know about it…? 🥺  
That’s what I’ve been up to ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Oh and I’ve also been watching scary videos
I’m really good at watching scary stuff
☀️ Did you give Lynn unnie a kiss?

Yup, I did  
ㅎㅎ  
Only ShiOn unnie hasn’t gotten one yet ㅜ  
Actually, I came to fromm as soon as I woke up ㅎㅎ
☀️ Was there anything fun that happened while practicing for the tour?

Hmm... 
Playing games and just chatting?
I heard it snowed a lot
Did you all see it?  
I haven’t seen it yet  
But my friends sent me pictures on KakaoTalk
☀️ What kind of KakaoTalk emoticon do you and your friends use, SeoAh?  
They cost money, so I keep hesitating on which ones to buy

Wait a sec!
Let me check  
There’s Dyu.. Ganadi, Peek a boo, it's Gosim! and Useless Bear  

`[These were not sent in the chat, they are just for context]`
`[These are the KKT emoticon packs mentioned above]`

We mostly use those three
I didn’t use KakaoTalk much before, so I didn’t have many emoticons
But these days, I use it more and have been buying more emoticons compared to before
Lately, I’ve been rewatching Lovely Runner ㅎㅎ<sup>[K-drama]</sup>
I don’t have much time, so I can’t watch a lot 
but I think I’m on episode 2 now ㅎㅎ
I kind of want to do a cover of Sudden Shower <sup>[Lovely Runner OST]</sup>  
After the overseas tour ends, I’ll prepare for it
For my New Year’s song, I’ve been listening to I Ain’t Worried
Top Gun is my all-time favorite movie 🤤🤍  
I watched Top Gun: Maverick
Hihi
☀️ Isn't Netflix the OTT platform SeoAh uses the most? 😿  
I only have a Netflix subscription, so I can never follow SeoAh's recommendations ㅜㅜ

OTT <sup>[Over-the-top media service (streaming platforms)]</sup>
I’m only using TVING these days
What was everyone’s first song of the New Year?  
Wow

`[11 minutes later...]`

I’m back 
I did something for a bit
I ate lunch, I ate rice cake soup 
Moana came out recently, right?  
I really want to watch it but I keep oversleeping
so I haven’t been able to watch it yet ㅋㅋㅋ
I haven’t watched Wicked either ㅎㅎ  
크크
I’m really looking forward to the overseas tour
I want to get a massage ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
They’re famous, you know <sup>[in TH]</sup>
And I’m excited for the fruits
It’ll be my first time visiting the US and Canada
☀️ Is there a country you haven’t been to yet that you really want to visit?

Hmm
Maybe somewhere with a beautiful ocean?  
I’m not sure yet 
ㅎㅎ
I'm going now ㅎㅎ  
Have a great day 
Let’s do our best this year too !!
