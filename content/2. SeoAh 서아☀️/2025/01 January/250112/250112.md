SeoAh's letter to WAVs after the Bangkok concert

#SeoAh #서아

The concert in today was amazing. Honestly, since this was my first overseas tour, there were so many things I could’ve done better. Still, I’m incredibly grateful that you enjoyed the performance so much. I know I’m far from perfect, but I’ll keep working hard to show you even better sides of myself. Even though the Bangkok leg of the tour has come to an end, I really hope to come back. Personally, I love summer and the weather here was just perfect. Not too hot, just the vibe I love. Even though I’m leaving tomorrow, I’ll never forget this experience and will always treasure it. Thank you WAVs for making my first overseas tour such an unforgettable memory 🤍

I was just about to sleep, but I suddenly thought of this and came back to write this letter
`[VM: I missed you]`

It’s been a while since I last performed and it was so funㅎㅎ  
But there were so many songs, it was exhausted
Weirdly enough, during rehearsal, I was really struggling 
But when I was backstage earlier, I kept thinking “I want to perform ASAP” and suddenly my energy went up
No Fate – ECLIPSE-nim
I know it might seem like I always recommend the same songs
but I swear, it’s because I’m really listening to them
크크
It’s almost 4 am there, huh?<sup>[KST]</sup>
It’s almost 2 am here<sup>[THA]</sup>
`[VM: I’ll give you a spoiler for the Reels I filmed with DaHyun unnie.` 
`Chaek chaek chaek jik jik jik]` 
<sup>[t/n: Don't ask me, I have no idea eitherㅋㅋ]</sup>

I ate durian today
I actually tried it two years ago
The taste was okay, but since it wasn’t in season, it was just so-so 
It didn’t smell that bad
Today for lunch, I ate Kimchi-jjigae
it’s the first time I nearly finished an entire meal abroad...
For some reason, I don’t usually eat well when I travel
크크
But it was delicious 
Anyway 
It's good
