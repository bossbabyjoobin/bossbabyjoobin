SeoAh's change of heart on acting cute around her unnies 

#SeoAh #서아 #fromm

These days, I've been acting all cute around the unnies  
I've also gotten way more into skinship lately  <sup>[Skinship = hugging etc etc]</sup>

🌊 SeoAh~ I'm curious... are you still flirting with JooBin these days? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

No no ㅋㅋ  
My aegyo decreased a bit ㅋㅋ
Even the stylists say so 
They say I’ve matured ㅋㅋ  
I can't act cute these days
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
What do you mean adolescence!?!?!?!
-.-  
I’m leaving
