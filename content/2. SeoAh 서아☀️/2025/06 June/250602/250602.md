Thanks for coming today ~~ 🖤  
Don’t I look like a rapper in these pics?  
Even my pictures got posted on SNS today
How were they?
ㅎㅎ  
☀️ Haerin-ah, do you not bring Toto with you anymore..??

I brought it during badge war 
No, I mean It's packed in my suitcase, you just didn’t see it ㅜㅜㅋㅋ
Right, you didn’t get to see it…
But it’s always with me, right by my side
I think I’ve had it for over 10 years now?
When I was little, my dad brought it when he came down from Seoul  
It even had clothes at first but they’re gone now

My birthday’s in 9 days
Isn't that amazing
Hihi  
Just now, I got a message from Seungjoo and she asked 
“Was it your makjang<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">(막장)</font></sup> yesterday??” <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: typo, ㅂ is beside ㅈ] </font></sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
Turns out she meant to say makbang <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">(막방)</font></sup> <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: 막방 = last music show]</font></sup>
but she typed makjang instead ㅋㅋㅋㅜㅜ  
So cute  
SAY MY NAME Seungjoo!!  
Isn’t she adorable  
크크
Seungjoo is cute
