"People and money"
Protect our maknae from this cruel world

 I kinda want to go for a walk later  
☀️ Gotta make another bug friend again 😉

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I should  
☀️ Not too long ago, NaKyoung even said she was super thankful because SeoAh caught a bug for her! ㅋㅋ

I’m the CESCO of tripleS  <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: CESCO is a pest control service]</font></sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
☀️ SeoAh, are you not scared of bugs??

Hmm  
It’s not that I’m scared, I just don’t like them  
But, even if they’re around  
As long as they don’t come near me, it’s fine  
☀️ But if you hate them, how do you catch them?????

Hmm  
I just hate screaming more than the bugs 
So I have this mindset that it’s better to get it over with quickly and catch it
ㅎㅎ  
☀️ Then what’s Haerin’s favorite animal?

I like all of them  
🤍🤍  
☀️ What about ghosts? Do you believe in them?

Ghosts…  
I do believe in them but I’m not scared  
☀️ What’s SeoAh most afraid of?

Hmm  
People and money 💸  
Is that too realistic? ㅋㅋ
