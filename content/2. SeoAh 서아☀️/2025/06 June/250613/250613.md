☀️ I'm watching Badge War right now… but seriously, how are you so fearless? I totally fell for you watching you play Russian Roulette… 😳😳

There’s actually a behind-the-scenes story to that  
I made a mistake in voting <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[t/n: she voted for herself]</sup></font>
…  
If I could go back to that moment  
I wouldn't do it again…  
-3-  
But actually… I cried that day  
Not because it felt unfair
but because I couldn’t get my suitcase that day
So I couldn’t even brush my teeth
Couldn’t get Toto either  
ㅜ  
But I ran pretty well, didn’t I?~~

☀️ I know it's just a variety show… but it still hurts to watch 😢

Yup, that's right
Me too, my heart hurts  
I couldn’t bear to watch it
But honestly, the running scene was fun
I really didn’t think I’d win
right up until the very last second
But then unnie missed it and I grabbed it right after
ㅎㅎ
