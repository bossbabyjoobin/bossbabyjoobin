By the way, did something come out? Gravity?  
?  
Wait a sec
Ohh it’s out on YouTube  
Daebak  
Ohh I’ve got a fierce concept this time  
Wow  
😎😎  
But honestly
I want to be in Team A <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: beacause of the songs]</font></sup>
~0~
☀️ I hope Haerin gets to do something like Bo Peep Bo Peep<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[T-ara] </font></sup> and Oh! my mistake<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[APRIL] </font></sup>

Ooh  
I wanna cover Bo Peep Bo Peep
Or if not, then TT or Heart Shaker
I used to dance to TT a lot when I was young
ㅎㅎ  
I’m listening to TT again after so long
So nostalgic
🥹🥹🤍🤍  
I’m looking forward to the gravity
I kinda wanna do 폭주하는 <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: check below]</font></sup>
da ra da da da ra
크크
I’d probably do even better if it were a cute concept
But still, this is my chance to try something fierce
