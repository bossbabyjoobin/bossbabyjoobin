What are you doing?
I'm at the shop/salon
크크
ㅎㅎ
Today's Music Core stage was so much fun  
And the ISEGYE festival made me so happy  
During Girls Never Die 
I got really emotional  
Just… seeing someone get excited and happy 
because of a stage or song I was part of
<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: found a clip of that exact moment, check below]</font></sup>
ㅎㅎ  
But seriously  
being on stage is so much fun
I want to do it more often hihi 
I wish May would never end
May, don’t go ㅜ  
Let’s keep having comebacks...
Like four times a year..  
three unit comebacks and one full group comeback
Seriously..  
I really want to do that  
☀️ MODHAUS, please let SeoAh have a comeback whenever she wants

(*Gasp*) 
If that actually happened, we’d be having comebacks 365 days a year
But seriously  
I want to try out different songs and concepts too
like “Hey, we’re good at this kind of concept too!” 
Personally, I’d love to do a comeback one day  
with one of the B-side tracks from this album
That’s why I still listen to them ㅋㅋㅋ  
Even the AI-generated ones
I listen to all of them
They were all good but Song B was totally my style 
<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: there you go, another WWW  truther^~^]</font></sup>
But 깨어 (Are You Alive) turned out so well too
so I’ve been listening to it a lot lately
☀️ Is there a concept or music genre you really want to try at least once?

KiiiKiii's I DO ME
I want to try something like that
I really love that kind of vibe
This year  
I’m curious what kind of unit will debut
And next year, I hope we can all do something together  
like LOVElution and EVOlution did  
If we start preparing at the end of this year
maybe we could do a unit comeback in February
a full group comeback in May
another one in July or August 
and one more in September  
That would be perfect
I like living a busy life  
The busier we are
the more chances we get to meet WAVs
