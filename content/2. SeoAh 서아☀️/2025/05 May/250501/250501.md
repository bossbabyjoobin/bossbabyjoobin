Wise words from our maknae

#SeoAh #서아 #fromm
___
Today  
It’s raining
so don’t forget your umbrella
It's raining a lot ㅜ  
We were supposed to take our graduation photo today
but it got canceled
😢  
☀️ SeoAh, my average score for midterms is 30… We’re the same age…

Heol  
I think you scored even lower than me
But it’s okay
Studying isn’t everything in life  
Ahh
Was that a lie?
;;;;;
