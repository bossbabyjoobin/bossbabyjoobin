WAV ~~ 🤍🤍🥺🥺  
Thank you so much.. really
I don’t think I’ll ever forget today 🥺🥺  
I was so happy
And earlier, during the Detective Soseol stage…  
I… teared up
Right after the first chorus ended
I was standing next to you
and I just really felt "this is what I want to do"
I missed you and I wanted to be here (on stage)  
Before I even realized it, I teared up
I just want to do more. I want to see you more
Today made me feel it even more deeply
that I’m truly, genuinely happy doing this
When I first became a member of tripleS, honestly
I had a lot of worries
I kept wondering “Is this really the right path for me?”  
But these days, I feel it more and more
I’m happiest when I’m doing this
It’s real 
I’m just so thankful
I really wish May wouldn’t end
Each day passes so quickly, which makes it feel even more bittersweet...
I really really don’t want May to end
I was so happy today

What are you doing? 
I miss you  
I’m heading back to our dorm now~~  
Thank you for making us 1st place on Show Champion today  
I'm so happy again today
ㅎㅎ  
From now on, I’ll work even harder so I can do better during encores..  
I wasn’t completely satisfied with my part today
so I’ll keep working hard to do better next time
I really will try!!
Still, getting 1st place today made me so happy!!  
It was seriously nerve-wracking…  
Right up until we stepped on stage
I made a wish 
"Please let us win today"
Also, I was really happy I got to do the ending shot with DaHyun unnie today  
ㅎㅎ  
The night before, I told our makeup ssaem 
“I hope I get to be in the ending shot with DaHyun unnie…”
Hehe  
So I was super happy again today ㅎㅎ
Time is flying by so fast 
It’s already the second week of promotions  
Just thinking about the last stage already makes me feel sad
But it’s okay!  
We still have more left!!  
Hehe  
Let’s keep seeing each other often  
Hehe  
Ah, right!!  
Next week, I’ll get to see my brother at a music show
Hehe  
I just wanted to say it~  
Isn’t that amazing??  
My brother works in fashion industry
so we’ll be seeing each other there haha  
It feels kind of weird
but...
I just wanted to share even the little things with WAVs
Hehe..  `[250521] 10:41 PM`
