Hi~<  
Wow  
It’s our first comeback in a year~~  
It’s been so much fun
I had a great time today too
From KCON up to now
every day has been filled with happiness
While preparing from KCON until now
I didn’t get much sleep, so I was a bit tired
but the moment I saw WAVs, I turned into a puppy right away 
크크
I missed you  
But now, we get to see each other again
Oh right
The music video
The bicycle scene  
I was originally supposed to be in that scene
but since I can only ride a tricycle
so they had to pick another member  
ㅋㅋㅋ
Also, at KCON 
I got close with Seungjoo  
ㅎㅎ  
I made a same-age friend

And what do you think of my purple hair?  
You might not have noticed, but my bangs...
Should I say they got cut?  
Anyway, they kinda got chopped off  
So today, I had to do the perilla leaf hairstyle 
🥺🥺
It’s okay though 
I’ve been dying to tell you I bleached my hair 
and finally!!
