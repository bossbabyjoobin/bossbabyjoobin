Hiii
I’m not late today
I didn’t come late 
Thankfully, I wasn’t even late for class
I sat right at the front
so I couldn’t sleep...
🌊 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Was it because you were at the front or were you staying awake to protect your seatmate? <sup>[For context, check 241122 trans]</sup>

Both..?  
But still, I paid attention in class, so that’s good
But ㅋㅋㅋ  
I saw a familiar name on fromm and told a friend about it
that someone with the same name was on fromm
Turns out, it’s our friend
We used to take Taekwondo classes together as kids
I immediately told them to turn off the notifications ㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
They thought subbing meant including all 24 members
I was so shocked for a moment…
🌊 How does it feel to have become your friend’s bias? ㅋㅋㅋ

Not much… ^~^  
We fight all the time ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But suddenly…  
(Now) It's feels awkward  
크크
Also, it’s a friend I’ve been close with since childhood
so it feels kinda weird in a way
Today, the MMA video came out
Hehe  
I’ve been working hard for it
크크
Spoilers are a secret
I just wish time would pass quickly
I kinda want everything to be over soon?
Like, I feel this urge to get things done quickly
I even want to get married quickly ㅋㅋ  
I’m just naturally impatient
I’ll marry [Y/N] ㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But honestly, I’d at least want to get married in my early 30s
I want to start a family early  
Babies are so cute  
I’ve always liked babies, but lately, they’re even more adorable
I’m not a baby though
Saying I'm a baby is not allowed
-.-

`[t/n: I hope none of y'all take this marriage thing so seriously because she's just 14 and it'll probably change over time ^~^]`
