Good night
ㅎㅎ  
What’s everyone up to?  
I came because I missed you
크크 I missed you 
but I got caught up in something and ended up coming this late
I’m excited for the MMA too
ㅎㅎ  
I've been working hard preparing for the stage
What’s everyone doing up so late?
🌊 Since It’s getting colder, I’ve been listening to a lot of ballads lately

Me too…  
But I lost my AirPods, so I haven’t been able to listen to music these days
Still, it was nice because I got to hear sounds around me that I hadn't noticed before
It felt refreshing
For now, I bought a pair of wired earphones
As for AirPods, I’ll save up some more money..?
I took out my long padding 
I’m going now  
I’m tired…  
Sleep well
Hwaiting for tomorrow too !
