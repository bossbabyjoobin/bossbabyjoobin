Here’s a translation of the new text into English:

"Hello,  
I came by before bed  
I couldn’t sleep, so I’m here  
Haha  
We wrapped up the Japan showcase well!  
🌊 I heard everyone’s in single rooms now—aren’t you scared?ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ  

Toto is next to me  
Haha  
**'Am I Broken' by 10cm-senpai**  
Actually, even though I’m in Japan listening to Japanese songs,  
I’m still recommending this one 😏💓  
We lost the game today..  
Haha  
😞  
I’m watching from Japan too..  
Anyway  
I’m doing well in Japan  
This time,  
I bought lots of cosmetics  
I also got Hanggyeodong and Panju Bunny  
Kiki  
I drank a lot of soda-flavored ice cream  
It’s so good..  
💓💓💓💓💓💓  
Also, that potato chip Mayu unnie recommended was so delicious  
Kuku  
It’s a shame I couldn’t watch the game properly today  
I was singing along to the cheer song while watching.. Haha  
It was fun  
🌊 Hong Chang-ki~~~ Hit, hit, hit Hong Chang-ki!  
Hong Chang-ki~~~ Hit that ball~~~ ❤️❤️  

-.-
I know that gif  
Haha  
Han Jun-su's cheer song is fun..  
Almost all of them are fun  
VM1  
Sorry, I’m a bit… embarrassed  
🌊 If you’re a Gyarin (KIA fan), you have to shout proudly!!! Shout “KIA forever” wherever you go!!!  

Uh...okay, I got it..  
But the other team’s cheer songs.. hmm  

VM2  
No more hits..  
The cheer songs are so catchy...  
Park Jung-woo’s cheer song is my favorite too  
The moves are fun  
VM3  
It’s fun...  
I only know KIA’s cheer songs properly...  
Sorry to fans of other teams  
Haha  
At first,  
it was fun watching players like Teshyung (player), Kim Do-young, Park Chan-ho, and other key hitters,  
but lately, I’m enjoying it all  
VM4  
🌊 So you’ve been a KIA fan for about a month now—what’s drawn you in so suddenly?  

Honestly,  
I’ve had an interest since middle school,  
but I got hooked after seeing Kim Do-young's cycling hit and 30-30 performance. He was so cool...  
And my friends influenced me too  
Haha  
Did you watch the showcase yesterday?  
I’m curious  
That’s good  
I wore a headband yesterday  
I wore it because I wanted to  
How was it?  
Kuku  
For the second part, I switched to pigtails  
I’m an athlete senior, haha  
Kuku  
I ate ramen today  
It was a bit salty for me...  
But it was still delicious  
👍👍👍👍  
The translator said it was 'miso,'  
so I had spicy miso ramen  
Ah, but I really want to watch baseball  
I watched some videos from when I went to the stadium  
Ugh  
I want to be in that excitement again  
Cheering feels so thrilling  
Once, I lost my voice the next day  
Haha  
I really want to catch a foul ball someday  
Dad said he’d catch it for me  
Haha  
To catch a home run ball, I need to sit in the outfield seats..  
But I sat in the infield...  
😞  
It’s okay, I’m the strongest  
I’ll watch the highlights and go to bed...  
Haha  
Goodnight  
Oh, I’ll watch yesterday’s highlights and then go to sleep  
Kiki  
Goodnight  
Bye-bye  
You worked hard today too!"
