What are you doing? 
School starts tomorrow  
When will summer break come back?  
How am I seriously feeling zero excitement about this?  
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ 
Maybe it's because we don't even have our class assignments yet
ðŸŒŠ Isnâ€™t your only concern getting a classroom on the second floor?

Yup ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ 
Please, just let it be the second floor, chaebal...
If you keep teasing me, Iâ€™m not giving you a gift
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ 
Hurry up and pray with me so I get a 2nd floor classroom
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹

That was from Saturday, the day before yesterday
I was coming back from OLIVE YOUNG, holding conditioner in one hand
ã…‹ã…‹ã…Œã…Œã…Œã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹
ðŸŒŠ Why didnâ€™t you just order same-day delivery?

I completely ran out that day, so I had to go buy it  
I already have shampoo
Since I use hair spray, I have to rinse with conditioner first, then shampoo
I always use conditioner
ðŸŒŠ So your conditioner must run out first

Yup, I need it to break down the hair spray before shampooing
Shampoo alone doesnâ€™t work because we use so much hair spray 
that our hair basically turns into a snack...
And compared to the other unnies, I use even more
I want my hair perfectly set. If it shifts even a little, I donâ€™t like it
So I just tell them to spray as much as they want
and thatâ€™s why it turns into a snack
ðŸŒŠ Well, then you can eat it when youâ€™re hungry

No jam TVâ€¦  
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹
But itâ€™s getting cold again starting today
Time to bring out the padding
I heard itâ€™ll be totally warm from April onwards though
I'm excited hehe
I want to eat yukhoe <sup>[t/n: yukhoe = steak tartare]</sup>
Oh yeah, when I went to Hong Kong, we ate at a Korean restaurant
and I tried ganjang-gejang <sup>[soy sauce marinated crab]</sup> for the first time  
I was so surprised at how good it was
I vaguely remember taking a tiny bite once before  
but I didnâ€™t like it back then, so I never tried it again
But this time, it was so delicious
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹  
I still havenâ€™t tried yangnyeom-gejang <sup>[spicy marinated crab]</sup> though
Iâ€™ll make sure to try it next time
I actually eat really well but surprisingly, there are a lot of things I havenâ€™t tried 
like agu-jjim <sup>[braised spicy monkfish]</sup> 
Iâ€™ve never had it either. Iâ€™ll try it someday
I do like seafood but I canâ€™t eat raw oysters  
I tried them once and they were too fishy 
But I love shrimp 
My top seafood picks are shrimp and yukhoe  
Wait, yukhoe isnâ€™t seafood 
Maybe I got confused because itâ€™s raw
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹  
Okay, then shrimp is my favorite seafood
I also like san-nakji <sup>[live octopus sashimi]</sup>
ðŸŒŠ Flatfish sashimi vs Salmon sashimi?

Flatfish
I like salmon too but if I had to choose, Iâ€™d go with flatfish
ðŸŒŠ Whatâ€™s your go-to sauce for sashimi?

Soy sauce or chojang...?
I canâ€™t eat wasabi
I even take it out of sushi  
I eat pretty much everything but I actually have pretty distinct palate
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹
Other than vegetables, the one food I really canâ€™t eat is cheesecake <sup>[ðŸ¤¯]</sup>
No matter how many times I try, itâ€™s just not for me
I don't like cheesecake
Ah and zero-calorie drinks
ðŸŒŠ Because theyâ€™re too rich? <sup>[t/n: rich = creamy, buttery, fatty, greasy]</sup>

Nope, I actually love rich foods
I just donâ€™t like the cheese flavor in cheesecake <sup>[I'm speachlessðŸ˜‚]</sup>
The only cheeses I like are mozzarella and cheddar
Everything else is a no-goâ€¦  
Especially cube cheese, itâ€™s just not my thing <sup>[like Belcube]</sup>
ðŸŒŠ If you like rich foods, is carbonara your go-to pasta?

Yup ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹  
I prefer cream pasta and carbonara
ðŸŒŠ But carbonara has cheese in it too

Grated cheeseâ€¦??  
Thatâ€™s basically like mozzarella, so itâ€™s fine  
I love mozzarella cheese
ðŸŒŠ What about ricotta cheese?

Nope, donâ€™t like it
ðŸŒŠ What about parmesan, the kind you sprinkle on pizza?

I used to hate it but I got a little more used to it as I got older
ðŸŒŠ And the cheese in salads?

Nopeâ€¦
ðŸŒŠ You might grow to like other cheeses too ã…‹ã…‹

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever like cheesecake or cube cheese though
ðŸŒŠ Youâ€™re really firm about the foods you donâ€™t eat

Yup ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹  
Iâ€™ll try things once but if I donâ€™t like them, thatâ€™s it. I would never try it again  
I even tried pig brain once but the texture wasnâ€™t for me
I donâ€™t like pudding and it had a similar texture to it, so nope
I can even eat intestines but pig brain felt too much like pudding, so I didnâ€™t like it  
I can also eat dishes with blood but I donâ€™t particularly enjoy them
Again, because of the texture
ðŸŒŠ But when you went to Japan, you bought a ton of puddingâ€¦

Yup and none of it was for me
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹  
I bought them for my family
My older brother and younger sibling love pudding
Iâ€™ve only ever tried Japanese fruit pudding once
Other than that Iâ€™ve never even thought about trying any
I just donâ€™t like pudding, so I never bother
Even that super famous Japanese pudding? Iâ€™ve never tried it
ðŸŒŠ Whatâ€™s your favorite Japanese snack?

Yakisoba bread  
I love it. That will never change  
If you ever go to Japan, you **HAVE** to try it  
Highly recommend
I'm going now
izna â€“ FAKE IT  
[Y/N] I love you
