Sorry, I'm totally bare-faced...  
Ahh!
But I did put on sunscreenㅋㅋㅋ
.. and lip balm too!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
These are my prescription glasses, so the light reflection is inevitable
And sunscreen is a must every day

This was from Hanteo  
Ha.. the difference is hugeㅋㅋ<sup>[t/n: w/ and w/o makeup]</sup>
Do you like Simple-looking Rine?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ If my skin's in good condition, I'll bring more pics like this more often
For Hanteo, I tried pink lenses..  
How was it?  
You can spot the pink lenses now, right?
크크크
And since you really liked my BOSS outfit, it’ll be posted on the official account soon
I took so many pics..ㅋㅋㅋ
I wonder what I'll look like at D Awards?!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Ohh! And at Hanteo, I took pictures with ARTMS sunbaenims><  
Got to greet JinSoul unnie after a long time too ><  
I was so happy... 😭😭
But seriously, they were all so pretty...  
I almost ran to the standing section mid-show...
