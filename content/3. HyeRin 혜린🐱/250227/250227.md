Yesterday, HyeRin unnie made chewy cookies
and seriously, it was the most delicious chewy cookie I’ve ever had
One bite and I was completely hooked
So I said *"Unnie, this really delicious..😍"*  
It was so good
For about 2.5 seconds while eating it, I thought, *"Oh, I should try making this myself"*
But then I dropped the idea real quick and just kept eating
I’d seen the recipe before
and it takes a ton of time, effort and skill
So I decided to just enjoy eating it instead
^~^

🐱 You made chewy cookies?  
Binnie said it was the best cookie she's ever had?  
Did you finally get it right after that last live?

🐱💜 Whoaaa! That's right  
Wait a sec

Ta-da!  
Somi’s foot ended up in the shot ㅋㅋㅋ
<sup>[t/n: Somi = HyeRin's doggo but she considers Somi as her sib]</sup>

I did a good jobㅎㅎ
If I have time, I’m thinking of making other stuff too
When I stay quiet and focus while making it at home, I don’t mess up
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
