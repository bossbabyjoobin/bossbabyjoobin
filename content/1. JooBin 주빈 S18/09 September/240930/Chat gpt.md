Did you watch JooManSa??  
😚😚  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
The K that was mentioned as a hint was  
Kawakami Rin unnie's K!  
ㅋ  
ㅎ  
It was filmed a while ago, but it finally came out ㅎ  
We actually filmed it while talking about NEXT with Rin unnie.  
🫧 But Binnie, you seemed like quite the pro as the host now?

Arigatou~~`~~~~~`😉  
The first time we met,  
it's still vivid in my memory.  
The most exciting day of my life..  
😚ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 #DontLoveARockstarLoveNext

#NextIsTheRockstar  
🫧 It was nice to hear such details for the first time.

Right?  
There's actually more,  
but it took too long to reenact, so we stopped there.  
After our first meeting,  
we immediately took a V photo,  
rode in the car together awkwardly,  
and even saw the first snow together.  
❄️❄️❄️❄️  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
So even though I didn’t show it,  
it was one of the happiest days of my life.  
🫧 It would be fun if the four of us gathered again later to chat.

That'd be great.  
Actually, we're pretty active in our group chat.  
We even talked about various things in the group chat today.  
I had a dream where  
the NEXT unnies and I wore the fan concert outfits,  
getting ready to perform *Do It* backstage,  
cheering each other on,  
and just before we went on stage,  
I woke up.  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hehe  
Oh, it's Soomin unnie's time.  
Soomin unnie + Shinwi unnie + Jiyeon unnie + Seollin unnie + Chaeyeon unnie  
are all checking out my bed.  
Meanwhile, Soomin unnie is telling Chaeyeon and Shinwi unnies:  
"Did you know? Last time when I came back to the room after work,  
JooBin pretended to sleep by closing the curtains,  
so I wouldn’t bother her."  
She’s sharing this story.  
But it’s true.  
^~^~^~^~^~^  
Anyone could tell that if I made a sound,  
Soomin unnie would ask me countless questions,  
so I just pretended to pass out quietly.  
😉😶😶😶😶😶  
🫧 How did you get caught?

I didn’t make a sound, but it was noisy anyway,  
so I confessed to unnie the next day,  
"Unnie, I pretended to sleep because I thought you’d make noise when you came in,  
but it was still loud." ㅎ  
Soomin unnie,  
with this 🤓 face,  
said,  
"Oh, you weren’t sleeping? I thought you were."  
ㅋ  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It was just hilarious.  
Right now, the house living room is  
getting pretty noisy with decibels rising.  
Then Chaeyeon unnie says,  
"This house is fun."  
...  
I’m tired.  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 The living room has turned into a concert hall.

`+` Talk show  
^~*  
🫧 I’m getting drained in real-time ㅋㅋㅋ

Yeah, that’s correct...  
🫧 JooBin, next roommate: Soomin vs. Yeonji?

But well,  
I’ve already roomed with Soomin unnie,  
so I’d like to try with Yeonji unnie.  
🫧 Binnie, instead of chatting, go sing a song.

Don’t send me away!  
!!!!!!!!  
Chaeyeon unnie says,  
"It’s a relief that there are some normal people in this house."  
Soomin unnie asked, "Who?"  
JooBin. JiSeoYeon.  
But Jiyeon unnie seems to be getting a bit caught up in the chaos now too.  
Soomin unnie said,  
"Unnie, you walk so elegantly."  
Then Jiyeon unnie replied,  
"Na, I always ooh-ah ~~~~~~~~~ "  
TripleS is  
very☆special.  
^~^~^~^~^~^  
VM  
The bed tent is  
a must-have.  
Agreed.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Well,  
Should I send you a gift or not?  
I’m debating...  
Oh, I’m sending it.  
Wait  
Internet issues..  
I’m really not holding back...  
...  
I didn’t plan to play this long of a game, but...  
ㅋ  
Wait, what?  
VM  
... I’m really sending it.  
Oh no.  
I went out and came back in but,  
it’s not working.  
What’s going on?  
ㅠ  
They keep saying "wait a moment."  
Is this a patience test or what?  
![[GYu5tkFa0AAx8OY.jpg|150]]  
Whoa,  
it worked.  
Phew.  
ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
The last selfie of September  
is up.  
ㅎ  
VM  
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
How is it?  
Hehe  
There are two things I want to say.  
Do you want to hear the first?  
Or the second?  
The first is  
let’s have a great October too 🤍🤍🤍  
Let’s do our best!!!!  
And the second is  
I’m going to take a shower and be right back. Wait for me…….  
VM  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
Shower complete.  
ㅋ  
I’ll be back. Love you  
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
VM  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
What did you do? ㅎㅎ  
ㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅌ  
Let me suggest a meal  
How about bossam?  
Something light?  
Yogurt!!  
🫧 Something even lighter.

Just breathe air.  
^~^~^~^  
Zero calories~~~~  
The woman who even cares about Weibu’s health ^^  
Today,  
I had yukhoe.  
Nom  
Hehe  
🫧 Why didn’t you give me any?

Sorry  
🫧 Should we suggest tomorrow’s meal for Binnie?

Sure  
🫧 How about air!!!!!!?

Thanks  
🫧 How about shabu-shabu?  
Actually, Jiwoo recommended it.

I’ll eat with Jiwoo unnie.  
Wait  
Isn’t Jiyeon unnie  
basically a puppy?  
Isn’t she too cute???  
Her pose  
is like a carbon copy of Tone unnie’s.  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 So, who’s left for the teaser~?

You’re trying to trick me.  
They’re all revealed now, right?  
12 members.  
What, are you next?  
🫧 Binnie, when was the picture you sent today taken?

That  
was taken  
on the day we arrived for the Japan showcase,  
on the bus.  
📸📸📸  
Snap.  
🫧 Suddenly curious, Binnie! Besides NXT members, do you have photos of other members on your phone too? ㅋㅋ

Yeah,  
not joking,  
I think I have at least one picture of every member.  
🫧 Who do you have the most of?

First of all, me  
^~^  
Then MonSa  
Tone unnie  
Soomin unnie  
NEXT  
like this??  
Pictures I took of Tone unnie on our date,  
and photos I took of her often.  
As for Soomin unnie,  
she left so many traces of herself on my phone,  
so there are tons of her selfies in various versions……  
And the ones I took with the NEXT unnies during practice?!  
Seems like that’s how it is.  
🫧 Don’t you take pictures with a film camera, Binnie?

I don’t have one.  
But when Yeonji unnie brings hers,  
I occasionally appear in her shots.  
Yeonji unnie would say,  
"Binnie! I’ll take a picture for you, stand here!"  
I’d be like ✌🏻😉  
That’s how most of those pictures were taken.  
🫧 Have you gotten better at taking selfies?

ㅎㅎ  
I’m not sure.  
But I think my fixed angle is gone,  
and now I have like two options?  
A little? ㅎ  
I’ll go dry my hair now.  
^~*  
Let’s have a great October too, everyone.
