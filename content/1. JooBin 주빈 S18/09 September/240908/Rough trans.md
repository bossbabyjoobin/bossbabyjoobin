🫧 Tell me today's TMI🫶🏻🫶🏻

Today, I was with HaYeon unnie
and as we were walking in somewhere
we both reached for the door at the same time
While we were doing that, I thought to myself
(Should I sing Love is an open door or not?)
And then... I ended up singing it  
"Love is an open door ~~~~~~ "  
But at that exact moment, HaYeon unnie started singing it in Korean  
"Sarangeun yeollin mun ~~~~~~~~~~~ " <sup>[KR: 사랑은 열린 문] </sup>
We both said "Heol?!!!!!!!" at the same time <sup>[헐 - KR slang similar to What/OMG. In this context, it is used to express shock or surprise]</sup>
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ
Wow, I was singing it in English
and unnie was singing it in Korean!!!  
That's what I said to HaYeon unnie
Then HaYeon unnie said "I was actually debating whether to sing it or not"  
I replied "Wow, me too"  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Then we both ran around ㅎ

🫧 It seems like you've been spending a lot of time together at events lately.  
I guess it's fate ㅋㅋㅋ 

These days, we have a lot of schedules together
So yesterday, when we went to Daegu
at HaYeon unnie's request, we played games together ^~^ 
Even the mosquito that bit me and flew away...  
HaYeon unnie caught it for me

🫧 Oh, I heard about that ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 

What ㅜ When did she say that?

🫧 Wow did you fall in love with Hayeon? <sup>[EN]</sup>

No <sup>[EN]</sup>
But she did <sup>[EN]</sup>  
😏😌😌

🫧 HaYeon said she has a crush on Binnie?

Oh no...  
What should I do?  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 I did too <sup>[EN]</sup>  

What is this?  
Why with HaYeon unnie  
;;;;;;;;  
I'm speechless 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ




VV Vacation

🫧 아니 빈아! VV 바캉스 갔다메 알고 있었어??!!

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
우린 알지 ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㄷㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ
아 가끔은 몰라..
엥 너 그거 했어…? 넌 그거..? 언제..?
이런느낌..
바캉스는 알고 있었아
바캉스 맞나??암튼
멤버들이
단톡방에 촬영현장을
영상으로 보내줘서
보고 헐ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
잼겠다ㅏ
이랬지
난 약간
예고편에 편지 그걸 봤는데
그거 보면서
24인 마니또
하면 진짜
절대 못 맞추겠다..
재밌겠는데
이 생각했어
먼가
진짜 재미ㅛ을 듯
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 스포야?

아니긴 하지만
스포면 좋겠당 ㅎㅎ
나중에 시그널 신청..
모두가 모일 수 있는 날 언젠가..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 거의 연말이나 연초 대이벤트일듯

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
마니또가 언제부터 “대이벤트“ 였을까..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 Hey Binnie! Did you know VV (Vivi) went on vacation??!!

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ (laughter)  
We know ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㄷㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ (more laughter)  
Ah, sometimes I don’t know...  
Huh? Did you do that…? You did that..? When..?  
That kind of feeling..  
I knew about the vacation,  
Is it vacation? Anyway,  
The members sent videos of the shooting location  
in the group chat,  
and I watched them like, "Wowㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ"  
That looks so funㅏ  
That’s what I said.  
I kind of  
watched the letter in the trailer,  
and while watching that,  
I thought,  
“If we play 24-person Secret Santa (Manitto),  
we’d never be able to guess it..  
It looks like it’d be fun.”  
It somehow  
really seems like it’d be fun  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ (laughter)

🫧 Is that a spoiler?

Not really,  
but I wish it was a spoilerㅎㅎ  
Later, when we apply for Signal..  
Someday when everyone can gather..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ (laughter)

🫧 It seems like it’ll be a big event either at the end of the year or the beginning of the year.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ (laughter)  
Since when has Secret Santa been a “big event”..?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ (more laughter)
