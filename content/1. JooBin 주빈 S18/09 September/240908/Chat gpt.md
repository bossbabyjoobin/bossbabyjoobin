"Y/N" 모행 (slang for 'what are you doing')
Are you sleeping?
I didn’t think you'd be asleep
Haha
LOL
🫧 I was thinking, 'Oh, is Joobin not coming today?' and then you appeared.

Hoohoo
I just finished washing up
🫧 Joobin looked really pretty today.

Hehe
Haha
Oh, was she pretty?
ㅇㅋ
LOL
🫧 Tell me today’s TMI (Too Much Information) 🫶🏻🫶🏻

Today, while going somewhere with Hayeon unnie (older sister/friend),
we opened a door at the same time,
and as we pushed the door,
I was thinking to myself, 
(Should I sing "Love is an open door"?)
And then I actually started singing,
"Love is an open door ~~~ "
But at that exact moment,
HaYeon unnie sang the Korean version
Sarangeun yeollin mun ~~~~~~~~~~~ [KR: 사랑은 열린 문]
And we both went "What?!!!!!"
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ

Wow, I sang it in English,
and unnie sang it in Korean!
And then Hayeon unnie said,
“I was also debating whether I should sing it."
So I said, "Wow, me too!"
LOL
And then we ran around like crazy together.
🫧 It feels like you’ve been hanging out with Hayeon a lot lately, maybe it’s fate. LOL

Yeah, recently,
we’ve had a lot of overlapping events.
So even yesterday, on the way to Daegu,
Hayeon unnie requested we play games together ^~^
Oh, and the mosquito that bit me…
Hayeon unnie caught it and got rid of it in the car.
🫧 Haha, I heard about that LOL.

What, when did you hear that?
🫧 Wow, did you fall in love with Hayeon?

No but she did 😏😌😌
🫧 Hayeon has a crush on Joobin?

Oh no... what to do...
LOL
🫧 I did too.

What, why you with Hayeon unnie now?
(;;;;;;;;
I’m speechless.
LOL
🫧 Joobin, you’re the only one for me ㅎㅎ.

Haha, awesome.
🫧 Joobin, have you heard of banana vinegar?

Huh? I’ve heard of banana cha-cha.
🫧 Oh, I meant tomato vinegar.

..? What’s tomato vinegar?
Did you buy it?
Let me know how it is...
🫧 Apparently it’s famous in Jecheon.

Ah, I see.
🫧 Is eating banana cha-cha with Hayeon your couple’s signal?

Huh??
You must be really sleepy, Wave...
LOL
🫧 Recommend something to tease Joobin about.

Why should I be the one recommending that..? 
^~^~^~
I had rice bowl today.
Chicken katsu rice bowl.
But whenever I eat rice bowls,
I eat the egg blanket and toppings first.
Then I get full and don’t eat the rice,
so I always wonder: Why didn’t I just order the toppings..?
I just want to eat warm eggs and toppings.
The rice is just there to neutralize the salty taste.
Feels weird.
LOL
🫧 But it’s better when you mix everything with the rice ㅠ.

Yeah, but
when there’s sauce, I eat it with the rice,
but if not…
I eat the toppings first and get full.
Something like that. LOL
🫧 Ask them to remove the rice in the order.

LOL They might be confused.
🫧 From now on, don’t say rice bowl, just say you ate ‘the top.’

LOL
I ate ‘the top’ today ㅎㅎ.
Oh, earlier, Shinwi unnie sent a From.
Oh right,
the person next to her
was me.
LOL
Shinwi unnie was like,
“Jjagya, Jjagya! Ah, Dahyun, how do you mimic this ~~ ?”
So I was like,
“Jjagya! Jjagya!”
Then she was like, “Oooooh!!! Yeah, that’s it.”
And we both mooed together.
Jjagya! Jjagya! Jjagya!
LOL
🫧 Hey Joobin! Did you know VV went on vacation??

LOL
We know, of course. 
LOL
Well, sometimes we don’t know..
Like, “Wait, did you do that? You did that..? When..?”
Something like that.
I knew about the vacation though.
Was it a vacation? Anyway,
the members
sent videos of the shoot to our group chat,
and I was like, “Wowww, that looks so fun.”
I saw the preview with the letters,
and thought,
if they play a game like 24-person Secret Santa,
there’s no way they’ll figure it out.
It looks fun.
LOL
🫧 Is that a spoiler?

Not really, but I wish it was. Haha.
Maybe I’ll sign up for a signal later…
when we can all gather together someday.
LOL
🫧 It’ll probably be a huge event by the end of the year or start of next year.

LOL
Since when did Secret Santa become a “huge event”..
LOL
🫧 I want to see a vlog of Joobin going out alone.

Alone??
Where would I go?
🫧 Joobin visiting the neighbor’s house alone?

..? That just becomes
a group vlog if I call the members.
LOL
I’m not good at hanging out alone.
What does “hanging out alone” even mean?
Wave, you’re not good at being alone either, are you?
LOL
I guess I do like doing things alone.
I just realized I do everything alone.
;;; 
Heh.
It’s been a while,
I’m reopening the advice consultation booth.
🚪🚪🚪🚪🚪
🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔
Now accepting questions.
🫧 Open the door for me.

I already sang “The Door” today.
🫧 What should I do for fun tomorrow? It’s a big concern.

Tomorrow, have a solo meal and do some solo baking.
Go to a bakery by yourself.
^~*
🫧 Can you do aegyo (cute act)?

That’s not a concern, is it?
LOL
🫧 Why should I care about my GPA (school grades)? My GPA is Joobin.

..
GPA is probably important...
I think…
🫧 I know a kid who uses abbreviations they made up on their own, and it’s a concern.

Why do I feel attacked?
Oh well, just use them together.
ㅎㅎ
What abbreviations? ㅎㅎ
🫧 What’s the opposite of “boh-yeo” (to see)?

An-boh-yeo (can’t see) 😔😔
🫧 My concern is that I don’t have any concerns.

Eat some tangerines. 🍊🍊🍊
🫧 What’s the opposite of reporter (이기자)?

지자! (A wordplay joke: "Lose" ❌❌😵)
🫧 Is this really advice consultation..?

……..I’m a little confused myself.
🫧 I bought an apple, but it’s all mealy. What should I do?

Oh no, mealy apples are the worst.
Apples should be crisp.
Crunchy.
That’s when they’re tasty.
ㅠㅜ
🫧 What should I do when I can’t fall asleep?

Try the jellyfish sleep method Wave recommended.
But honestly, it doesn’t really work for me,
so I just use a steam eye mask... hehe.
🫧 Watery apple vs crunchy apple?

Crunchy apple.
🫧 I need to shower, but I don’t want to. What should I do..?

Once you start, it’ll feel ☆ great ☆, right?
Just shower quickly.
🫧 I saw someone in my class who looks like Nien. How should I talk to them?

??
Shhhh!!!!
Nien..?
(Or you could just turn around and go)
Like that.
🫧 I don’t think I should do that…?

...Haha
🫧 Joobin is so cute, I want to nibble on you. What should I do?

It’s Seoyeon unnie.
Ahhhhhh.
No nibbling allowed!
🫧 Have you ever been nibbled on, Joobin?

ㅜ
I dodged it for a while,
but eventually, I got nibbled on…
😧😬
🫧 Recommend a meal for tomorrow!! I’ll seriously take your suggestion.

Pho!!
🫧 Today, the group was split into 3 for different events. What are your thoughts on it?

It’s us,
but it felt amazing,
like “Wow,”
is this even possible??
ㅇㅇ........
^~^~^~^~*
🫧 I miss Joobin so much, it’s a concern.

There’s a solution for that.
Meet in your dreams.
😴💭💭💭💭💭💭💭
LOL
Hehe
LOL, goodnight.
I’m going to sleep now~~~
~ Today’s advice consultation booth is closed ~
Abrupt closing.
Hehe.
LOL
Goodnight.
See you tomorrow.
Take care today too.
Bye-bye.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good night!! Goodbye.
🤍
