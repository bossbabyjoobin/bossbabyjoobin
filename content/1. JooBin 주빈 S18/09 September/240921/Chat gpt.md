Heyyy  
I’m here  
!!!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Did you already forget who I am?  
Oh  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It’s me, JooBin  
🫧 JooBin-ah, it’s nice that the weather’s finally cooling down

Right?  
Suddenly, it feels like fall  
The weather just keeps changing on its own  
Dress warmly  
Don’t catch a cold!!!  
... ㅎㅎ Although, I already caught one  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Maybe Binnie is controlling the weather

Actually, I already cooked  
Well, not cooked  
More like a super simple baking  
I made cookies  
Surprisingly  
They turned out well  
^~~^  
No questions allowed.  
^~~^~~^~~^

`#AlreadyInMyStomach`  
Last time, Soomin unnie suggested we bake together  
But I wasn’t really feeling it, so I didn’t…  
But I kept thinking about it, as if I was being told to make them  
So I ended up making them on my own  
But they turned out so good  
I bought more ingredients to make them again  
Almond cookies  
Hehe  
🫧 Me too, Jo

I’ll make some for you🍪🍪👩‍🍳  
No, they’re not burnt  
Well, the first attempt was a slight miss  
But I succeeded on the second try  
🫧 I believe in you, Binnie, but I won’t eat them

What? Why not?  
🫧 So there’s a 50% chance I’ll get the burnt ones

Come on  
I’ve perfected it now  
It’s fine  
I mean, really, it’s fine ㅎㅎ  
🫧 You won’t burn down the dorm, will you?

Dahyun unnie said it smelled delicious  
Even though the first try didn’t work out  
But I guess it still smelled good  
🫧 Did Dahyun catch a cold too?

?  
...  
Let’s not talk about it  
No words  
🫧 I haven’t eaten yet, so I’m hungry ㅋㅋ

In that case  
Late night food call!!  
Not that I want to eat it, but  
Jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk?  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 That’s super high-calorie for this time of night..

It’s okay  
Not for me,  
but for WAVs  
Heh  
🫧 Binnie, have you ever tried doing Baek Yeoreum’s impressions?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ve seen it, Yeoreum unnie’s acting...  
Ah... the pen?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But when I watched, all I could see was Seoyeon unnie  
🤍🤍ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Is Jiwoo unnie appearing soon too?  
ㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Nien said Binnie seems the most normal in tripleS. Do you agree with that?

Yes  
I totally agree  
🫧 Why?

Why, you ask?  
It’s obvious!  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 By tripleS standards, though ㅎㅎ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Exactly  
Today, I took some pictures of Lin unnie  
They turned out so well  
I was shocked  
It’s like they fit perfectly in my heart  
ㅎ  
She’s so cute!!!!!  
🫧 How was Lin’s long hair?

When we picked her up, Lin unnie and I just looked at each other  
For three seconds  
ㅇㅅㅇ...  
With this expression  
And then I realized, “Oh, it’s Lin unnie”  
With long hair  
She hadn’t slept at all  
We both saw each other early in the morning  
So we were both like  
ㅇㅇ...  
With those eyes  
After I came to my senses,  
I was like, “Oh!!! Unnie, you’ve got long hair now!”  
That’s what happened  
Today, with the lack of sleep  
I got super hyper and told Yeonji unnie  
“Cherry up! 🍒”  
Like, 20 times  
Cherry up!!!  
Cherry your mind!!  
🫧 Wow… I bet the atmosphere froze around you

Yeonji unnie enjoyed it  
She laughed, saying “Binna’s no fun”  
^~*  
🫧 Yeonji is always laughing

She laughs at anything you say...  
🫧 I’m jealous you have Yeonji next to you, Binnie

How is it?  
Having an unnie who laughs at anything you say  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
WAVE  
I’m sleepy  
What do you think?  
?  
I just called, but you already knew it, didn’t you  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ll try to sleep early today  
See you tomorrow  
ㅎㅎ  
Love you  
❤️❤️  
Goodnight  
🤍
