Helloaaahhh  
What’s up  
🫧 Thinking of you  

It connected haha  
Today  
I was so tired  
I came really fast  
Haha  
🫧 I'm watching *School Attack* right now!! Haha  

I saw it too!!  
🫧 The Kangol hat is cute  

Hehe  
It felt like the first time I wore a beret  
Or maybe not  
🫧 I wouldn’t know, haha  

LOL  
Right ^~^~^~^~^  
🫧 Do you have any pictures of you as a baby?  

I’m not sure  
I don’t really remember taking a photo with a beret  
I guess I didn’t walk around wearing one  
🫧 There seem to be a lot of T-types at Binnie’s prom.. Anyway, I’m a cutie

Because of the wave, I’m becoming a T-type too.  
Pretty ><  
But honestly,  
I’m becoming more of a T-type  
What should I do  
;;;;;;  
🫧 Well, you've already become a T-type

? This is a real T  
What, is everyone here a T?  
Give me some reaction.  
LOL  
Thanks ^~^~^~^~^  
🫧 By the way, Binnie, what’s that thing in the fridge labeled "Binnie"?  

That’s the washed blueberries I stored.  
I washed them thoroughly.  
That’s why they didn’t go bad  
They stayed there  
Phew  
LOL  
🫧 Did a lot of Binnie’s stuff get thrown out?  

They organized everything, so there were many things I couldn’t find,  
but they were still there.  
💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺  
Oh, the one thing I’m sad about is that  
they filmed before my tent was set up,  
so I couldn’t show them my tent.  
ㅠㅡㅠ  
LOL  
If I had shown them the tent,  
they might’ve found it cozy enough to sleep in.  
LOL  
🫧 No wonder I saw Sumin's curtains in the room, but no tent when I looked for it, LOL

LOL  
Right  
I set it up the day after the filming  
But honestly,  
I’m so thankful they cleaned everything up  
It was so clean  
As soon as we entered the house,  
everyone was like "wow!"  
🫧 Was it really that bad?  

It wasn’t that bad,  
but still, because they cleaned,  
it was way, way cleaner.  
Really, it was the best  
🤍🤍🤍🤍  
The members who helped clean were probably tired, but I’m so grateful,  
they’re the best...  
LOL  
🫧 Let’s express our love, LOL  

Thank you-love 🫶🏻  
🫧 Is your nose better?  

Haha, yes!  
![[240925_S18_1.m4a]]  
🫧 Binnie, do you like this season?

I think I do.  
Actually, today was a bit warm and cold at the same time,  
but it’s the kind of weather where you can just wear a short sleeve with something over it.  
If it’s hot, take it off, and if it’s cold, put it on.  
It’s nice, hehe.  
🫧 Did you have dinner, Binnie?😉  

Yeah,  
and I’ll try something new for dinner  
It’s definitely decided  
It’s Jjimdak (braised chicken) today  
No question  
Reason?  
I just thought of it, hehe  
LOL  
🫧 Do you like taking walks, Binnie?  

I love staying home, hehe  
I do like walks ^~^~^~^  
🫧 Do you walk around inside the house?

It’s the best, isn’t it?  
🫧 What do you usually watch at home, Binnie? I’m curious!

Cooking/eating videos!!!  
Before bed, I watch *Signal*  
And we all know what signals someone else is filming, haha  
We wait like, "When’s it coming out?"  
🫧 Spoil it for me

When is *Signal* coming?  
Haha  
🫧 Waiting is the same for me  

Right...  
And when I watch what other members filmed,  
I think, "Oh, that’s what they filmed that day."  
Also, recently, I’ve started to find healthy food and eat things I didn’t eat before or grew to like.  
No, I still haven’t eaten gukbap (soup with rice) yet  
🫧 Broccoli and bell peppers?

Those were my favorites from the start 🫶🏻  
I tried mushrooms,  
avocados,  
and salmon!!  
I mean, I didn’t seek them out before,  
but they were fine.  
What the— my keyboard is acting weird  
The keys won’t work properly  
Why is it like thisㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
Huh?????  
Why isn’t it working?  
The consonants  
I can’t type them...  
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠWhat’s going on  
Oh no  
The other keys aren’t working either  
ㅂㅈㄷㄱㅅ  
OMG  
The room ate it  
The duck must be delicious  
??????????  
What, seriously, it’s not working  
Do I need to change my phone???????  
This is seriously weird  
Wait, let me log out and come back  
Rice cakes, bread  
Ohㅜㅠㅜㅠㅜ  
It was just a glitch in the program  
Phew  
That was close  
Hehe  
I typed "bread" and "rice cake"  
It’s all working now, yay!  
LOL  
🫧 Suddenly, I’m curious—do you play Minecraft too?

No, I can’t  
I’m really bad at games  
I’m not skilled,  
so I just don’t play  
I don’t play because I’m bad at it and don’t like it.  
That’s me!  
LOL  
🫧 You get better by playing more  

That’s one opinion,  
but I just don’t enjoy the process of improving.  
🫧 You don’t play because you’re bad at it, but maybe you’re just not interested, haha  

LOL, you’re probably right  
I just don’t find it fun  
🫧 My ideal type is someone who can’t play games  

Yes!  
🫧 Adding things Binnie can’t do:  
1. Cooking  
2. Sports  
3. Gaming *New!*  

No need to add more, haha  
🫧 My ideal type is Binnie  

I already knew that  
^~*  
[Y/N] !!!!!  
I’m going to go wash up first.  
Hehe  
Bye-bye!
