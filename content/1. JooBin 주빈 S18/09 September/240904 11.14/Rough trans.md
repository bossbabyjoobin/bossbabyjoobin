처음 하우스 입주하고
어떡하지어떡하지
아직 말 10마디도 안했는데
그 땐 텐트 설치도 안 해서
굉장히 개방적이였단 말이지
난 그래두
언니들이 먼저
말 걸어주고
내가 먼저 말 못 거는 게 보였는지
다현언니는 막
빈아 너 밥 먹었어?? 이거 같이 먹을래??
해주고🥹🥹🥹🥹
수민언니는
뭐 필요한 거 있으면 말행 ㅋ~~
이런 느낌
서연언니도
숙소생활이나 뭐 궁금한 거 있으면
편하게 물어봐
다 성격대로 먼저 말 걸어준 게
너무 고마웠아
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
🫧 나는 비나 애교부려봐 하잖아 ㅋ 어때 고맙지?

으응 너무 고마워서 날라갈 거 같아

JooBin shared a story about when she first moved into MODU HAUS and how the members helped her out

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 Bin-ah, I haven’t even spoken a word to my roommate yet but they’re eating chicken behind me... It looks delicious…  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Try asking if you can eat together…  
But I’m not good at that either…  
So I can’t really give you any tips…  
When I first moved into the HAUS  
I was like "What do I do, what do I do?"
I hadn’t even said ten words to anyone at that point
and since I hadn’t set up my tent yet <sup>[Recently, they set up a tent in their bed (SooMin started it), though I still  have no a clue what it looks like LOL] </sup>
everything was really open
But still, the unnies spoke to me first
Maybe they could tell that I couldn’t start a conversation myself  
DaHyun unnie was like
"Bin-ah, did you eat? Do you want to eat this with me?"
🥹🥹🥹🥹  
And SooMin unnie said
"If you need anything, just let me knowㅋ~~ " 
Something like that  
Then, SeoYeon unnie also said to me  
"If you’re curious about anything related to dorm life, feel free to ask me"
They all reached out to me in their own way  
and I was so grateful for that 
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

🫧 It was your first time living with a group, so of course it felt awkward, but the other members really took care of you, huh? 😙😙😙

Yupppp, that’s right

🫧 Did you do the same for the Glow members too? A Bin sunbae moment

Well
I wouldn’t say it was exactly a sunbae moment…  
More like I would timidly say "Uhm… If you need anything, let me know…!!'  
and I'd carefully ask… "Oh, do you want this…?"
ㅋㅋㅋ  
It was so awkward  
I was like "Perhaps I could get your phone number?"
ㅋㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Now that I think about it, It’s kinda funny
But back then, that was the best I could do 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You weren’t being all formal with SeoAh too, were you? ㅋㅋ 

Actually, at first, I was
But then SeoAh was the one who said
"Unnie, please speak comfortably…!" <sup>[Informal/casual]</sup>
So I was like  
"Oh, then you too… you can talk comfortably...!!!"
But back then, SeoAh said she couldn’t really drop the formal speech yet
and I was like "Oh no, did I pressure her too much? Should I tell her it’s okay to take it slowly?"
I had all kinds of thoughts running through my head
🫧 But SeoAh speaks so casually now ㅋㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Yup, ever since then~~~  
It just shows how comfortable she’s gotten with me
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
