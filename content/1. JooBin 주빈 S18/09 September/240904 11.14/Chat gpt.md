Sure! Here’s the translation with the laughs left in Hangul:

Hi  
What are you doing?  
[Y/N]!!  
🫧 Did you do well on the stage today? ㅋㅋ

후하후하  
You worked hard today  
🫧 I cheered with a light stick in support of Joo Bin today, did you see?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ엉  
Our wave  
I waved the light stick  
And secretly covered my face ^~^  
But I got caught  
🫧 Your hair looked kind of fluffy today, right?

Chaewon unnie gave me a nickname  
She called me a brown Pomeranian  
Brown Pome  
(Just for today)  
ㅋㅌㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
For the first time  
I had curly hair  
🫧 Please do that hairstyle again later, cutie

Isn't it too round?  
Did it look okay??!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Okay  
I'll try..  
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 It looked like a hairstyle that was trendy in Europe in the 70s

Is that a compliment? ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 It’s fine because you’re originally round~

ㅇㅏ하  
🫧 Very demure and mindful 🙂‍↕️

Kkkkkk good  
🫧 Your beanie picture came out, Strawberry!

헷  
Incheon e-Sports Challenge  
After it ended, on the way back  
Click  
The reason Strawberry appeared was  
I tried to wink, but the car shook, the phone shook, and the wink failed  
Just think of it as an emotional moment  
ㅎ소  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Was it to cover the wink with the strawberry?

I don't know what it was, but  
I think so  
A four-leaf clover and sparkles  
It just brings good luck  
Joobim  
Bubbles and ribbons  
I put them in because they were cute  
^~*  
Speaking of bubbles  
It reminded me of bubble tea  
🫧 I want to drink strawberry bubble tea

Oh  
I like brown sugar bubble tea  
My original pick was chocolate, but  
There was a bit of a change  
Chocolate - Brown Sugar - Chocolate - Red Velvet - Mango - Strawberry Custard - Mango - Brown Sugar  
Currently  
Sticking to brown sugar  
🫧 That’s too many changes??

..ㅎ헿  
🫧 There’s a new menu coming out at 공`*`. Sweet potato taro bubble tea? It’s supposed to be a little sweet and salty

Oh  
I like sweet potato  
But  
Taro…….is  
Not my style  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
The first time I drank it, I thought I drank something wrong  
허허허허헣헣ㅎ헣  
🫧 Why, what's the reason?

It was like.. a messed up barley tea flavor..?  
Since then, I haven’t tried it again, so  
I don’t know  
🫧 Can I make a random recommendation here??

ㅇㅋ  
Sushi.?!!?!?!  
Of course, I don't eat it  
But it’s something I want to recommend  
Sushi and cold soba  
🫧 Bini, ramen vs. cold soba?

Definitely cold soba  
Maybe because it’s summer  
Ah  
🫧 But it’s autumn now

.. ㅎ  
Shh  
You understood, right?  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bini, I haven’t said a word to my roommate, but they’re eating chicken behind me  
Looks delicious…

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ask to eat together…..  
But I’m also not good at that……  
So I can’t give you any tips……..  
When I first moved into the house  
What should I do, what should I do  
I hadn’t even said 10 words yet  
Back then, the tent wasn’t even set up  
So it was really open  
But  
The unnies approached me first  
They must have noticed that I couldn’t initiate conversations  
Dahyun unnie would say  
“Bina, did you eat? Want to eat this together??”  
So sweet 🥹🥹🥹🥹  
And Sumin unnie would say  
“Let me know if you need anything k~~”  
That kind of vibe  
Seoyeon unnie also said  
“If you have any questions about dorm life or anything, feel free to ask”  
I was so grateful that they all approached me first  
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
🫧 I asked Bina to act cute, right? Isn’t that nice?

Yeah, I’m so grateful I could fly away  
^~^~^~^~^  
🫧 It was your first time living in a group, so it’s natural to feel awkward, but the other members took good care of you😙😙😙

Yeah  
🫧 Did you do the same for Glow? Senior Bina moment

Well  
I wouldn’t call it a senior moment  
I was more like, “Um… if you need anything, let me know..!!”  
Carefully, “Uh, should I give you this…?”  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  
I was so awkward  
“Um… can I get your number…?”  
ㅋㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Looking back now, it’s funny  
But I did my best at the time  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 You didn’t speak formally to Seoa, right? ㅋㅋ

Actually, at first, I did  
But then  
Seoa said  
“Unnie, you can speak comfortably..!”  
So I was like  
“Oh, you can speak comfortably too…!!!!!!!”  
But back then, Seoa said  
She couldn’t really speak casually, so  
I was like  
“Oh no, did I pressure her too much? Should I tell her it’s okay to take her time?”  
I was overthinking  
🫧 But Seoa speaks casually now, ㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ그 이후론~~~  
That just means she’s comfortable  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
🫧 I want to tease Bina, but I can’t think of anything to tease

What? You don’t have to tease me  
Don’t feel pressured ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I mean, you don’t have to tease me  
Why are you trying so hard to come up with something  
It’s not necessary  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
Oh right  
Today, I had  
Salad, but  
I ordered a steak salad  
But the meat was  
☆ shaped  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋ  
Today was a fail  
Hope the next meat is a success….  
🫧 Bina’s taste buds are something else

They’re probably easy to satisfy  
1 Texture  
2 Temperature  
That’s it  
🫧 But Bina is picky about a lot of things

빙고 ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
There are still  
Many things I haven’t tried yet, so that’s why  
Things I want to try??  
Um  
Chicken feet?  
Raw fish?  
🫧 You haven’t tried chicken feet yet?

웅  
Raw fish either  
I’ve only had a bite of salmon  
I tried gopchang  
..  
But I think makchang and daechang are similar  
..  
ㅎㅎ  
Yeah  
I don’t really like squishy stuff  
Gopchang, makchang, chicken feet, raw fish  
They’re all kind of squishy, right?  
That kind of texture  
🫧 What about cartilages or chicken gizzards?

I don’t like either  
I also dislike fatty meat  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㄱㅌㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
Turns out I’m pretty picky.. Huh ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Have you tried organ soup or blood sausage soup?

오노  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Just  
Kind of  
A mix of a child’s palate and an old lady’s palate  
I’ll call it a collaboration  
Lover of sweet and savory  
ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Do you have a member whose taste matches yours?

Sumin unnie and Tone unnie  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Recently  
Sumin unnie said  
“Bina, you like red bean, right?”  
Totally  
Then she said she bought red bean powder that turns into red bean paste when mixed with water, so you can spread it on bread  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
She explained it all excitedly  
I was intrigued  
And with Tone unnie  
We’re kind of in sync when ordering food  
Sandwiches, salads, fruits  
We like fresh things  
We also like sweet things, so  
We often order together  
It’s twelve o'clock  
What’s this, what are we celebrating?  
Why is it suddenly like Merry Christmas?  
It’s not my birthday?  
..?  
Wave unity  
Is in sync ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Someone in this chat might have a birthday 😉 

ㅇㅋ 축하해 뉴군지 모르겠지만!!  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
하암  
Now that I’ve celebrated  
Time to go to bed  
ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  


Goodnight  
You have to go to bed  
At a time when no one expects it  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
