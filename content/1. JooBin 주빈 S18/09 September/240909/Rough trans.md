JooBin talked about working out with ShiOn and the upcoming Japan Showcase this week

#JooBin #주빈

Today, I gave my best effort during my workout
While I was exercising, I got a call from my mom
 <sup>*(Gasping)*</sup> "Mom... Why..."
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
So my mom said 
"I’ll call you later... message me ~~~~~~~ "
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I heard that ShiOn takes you to exercise? did you go together (today)?

... That's kind of scary?  
I prefer working out alone  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Before ShiOn unnie starts training me, I’ll work on building up my stamina first
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 ㅋㅋㅋ How about a special workout episode with ShiOn for JooManSa? ㅎㅎ

Maybe we could save that idea for the very last episode instead?
ㅎㅅㅎ  
With ShiOn unnie, I’d rather do a bread mukbang...  
Because asking about workouts is a bit difficultㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Not that I’m scaredㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
You know what I mean, right? ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 How does ShiOn work out that everyone keeps mentioning it?

It's just the standard workout
More like textbook exercises with perfect posture 
and calmly working the muscles
 
🫧 Does ShiOn check angles too? Like your posture and stuff?

Yes, that’s why I decided not to do squats in front of ShiOn unnie  
^~^  

The Japan showcase is already  this week 
Is that even real..?.?..?.?..??.?.???
I’m so nervous ahhhh
To be honest, I’m not nervous right now
🫧 Can you give us a little spoiler about which songs you'll perform at the showcase? ㅎㅎ

La la la
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Haaa.. That's ridiculous 

^~^~^~^~^~^
🫧 This is just like that last time when you hinted about the next JooManSa guest. There are 14 members with "K" in their names. How is this one any different? ㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Oh right
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Try to get it right
🫧 Is Binnie's greeting still "I'm Baby JooBin"<sup>[JP]</sup>

Hmm, please recommend something desu 
🫧 Boss Baby JooBin desu

Ohhhhh
Okay
I'll look into it <sup>[t/n: Prolly on how to say it in JP]</sup>

Is SooMin really that loud? 

#JooBin #주빈

Earlier, something scary happened
I was sitting on the couch in the living room, trying to dry my hair
The rest of the members were in their rooms
So I was the only one in the living room
Suddenly, the AI thing started saying "One two three four five six..."
It began counting by itself out of nowhere
I was like "What is that? Where is that sound coming from...???"
?-?...
I kept listening and realized it was coming from near the TV
So I said "Genie, be quiet" and turned it off <sup>[t/n: Ginie = Alexa/Siri equivalent in KR]</sup>
There was no one else around...
It was just me in the living room
and I hadn’t made a sound
But still, it kept trying to start a conversation on its own
Ah, but SooMin unnie was in her room
and she kept singing
so maybe that's why??
That could be it
Suddenly, I don’t feel scared anymore
🫧 The scariest thing is probably when SooMin is home but she's quiet

ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
