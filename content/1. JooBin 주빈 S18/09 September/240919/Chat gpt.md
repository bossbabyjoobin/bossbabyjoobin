Hello, Wav  
How was your day??  
🫧 I missed Bini so much that I almost cried my eyes out.  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
You already knew everything when you came~~~~~~  
🫧 I was really lonely after the showcase, but you coming every day makes me happy 🤍  

Since Wav is happy, I'm happy too 🤍  
🫧 What did Bini do today????  

Today  
It's a secret  
Hehe  
🫧 What did Bini have for dinner today???  

Today, originally,  
I didn’t know what to eat  
So I wasn’t eating  
But Seoyeon unnie ordered tteokbokki  
And told me to eat, so I snatched some from her  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I snatched it.  
Yesterday, didn’t I recommend tteokbokki?  
Unnie ordered it right after.  
To be honest, I had forgotten about it too,  
But in the end, I ate it—what a conclusion.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Seoyeon is watching Bini's From, it seems.  

Unnie, are you watching?!?!?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 It's me, Yoon Seoyeon. Yeah, I ordered it after watching From.  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Just one more day... and then... the weekend again...  

Congrats  
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨  
🫧 Somehow, today is a day where I really miss Bini.

Because of the nasal voice,  
It’s a bit funny,  
You know?  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Don’t listen to it again.  
^~^  
I have a cold,  
But I don’t have any cough or fever,  
Just a stuffy nose.  
It can't be helped.  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  
I’m not sick,  
But my voice  
Sounds really funny...  
It doesn’t sound like my voice at all.  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ

🫧 Who was imitating someone just now?

It was me.  
🫧 Who was imitating someone just now?

It was me.  
I told you, it was me.  
🫧 I want Bini to tell me their favorite snack or meal in Japan!!️  

I still can’t forget the amazement of gyukatsu 🥹  
Next time, I want to try curry udon.  
Or maybe the cream udon that Soomin unnie mentioned.  
I want to try some noodles.  
I’m not really into ramen,  
So maybe udon?!  
That kind of vibe.  
And  
Definitely,  
Absolutely,  
I want to try tamago onigiri.  
I went to a convenience store several times,  
But I never saw it even once..ㅠ  
Egg,  
Round,  
Rice ball-like,  
Soy sauce half-boiled egg rice ball,  
Or something like that.  
That one.  
🫧 Even as a Japanese person, I don't know it...

😱  
Is it not famous?  
Maybe that’s why it wasn’t there.  
Haha  
I’m sleepy  
Let’s think of a random conversation topic.  
There was something earlier,  
Oh, what would you do if you suddenly got 100 million won?  
I’d save it.  
100 million won worth of objects..?  
Sounds cool, right?  
🫧 What if you had to spend all the 100 million in one day?

Whoa,  
That’s too hard.  
Then let’s go on a trip.  
Where should we go, Wav?  
Space travel..?  
That’s an unexpected trip.  
Today is something else.  
Oh!!!!!!!!!!  
So pretty.  
Hyeri leader.  
Unnie’s  
Awesome pose  
✨  
📸  
Every day now,  
I look forward to it even more.  
Hehe  
I’ll go admire Hyeri leader unnie’s photos now.  
ㅎㅎㅎ  
Goodbye,  
Bye-bye

Sleep well  
See you tomorrow 🤍  
You did well today too.
