JooBin on the Y Magazine Shoot and the playful personalities of NXT members

#JooBin #주빈

<br>

🫧 Binnie Binnie, the photoshoot is out

Hihi
A different
Makeup
Concept
They even added freckles
"Oh wow, is this...me????"
Not exactly, but it kind of gives off that vibe 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I took a lot of pictures~~~~~~~~~~~
But I need some time to organize them
Thank you for waiting <sup>[Orig. KR: 기다려주시다니 (**감사합니다람쥐**) | gamsahamnidaramjwi]<sup>

>It's KR slang, it's an MZ gen thing ㅜㅜ, It's hard to understand if you don't know hangul but I'll try my best... Since Thank you (gamsahamni**da**) 감사합니**다** ends with **다** (da), Squirrel starts with **다** (da) **다**람쥐 (daramjwi), when combined, it becomes 감사합니**다람쥐** (gamsahamnidaramjwi), it's a wordplay that makes it, you know, cute(?) and playfulㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 YeonJi's behavior <sup>[t/n: Referring to the slang usage above]</sup>

I tried copying ShiOn unnie
ShiOn unnie always says Gamsahamnidaramjwi
Even during practice, she goes Gamsahamnidaramjwi  ㅎ
At first, I thought
"Oh, that's just her personality...!"
But later on, I realized
It's kind of annoying <sup>[t/n: should be taken lightheartedly^~^]</sup>
🤍🤍🤍
NXT, we really enjoy annoying each other 
But when things get tough, it's like
"(*Crying sound*) ㅜㅜㅜㅜ🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹"
"We can really do it...!!!! ㅠㅠㅠ Hwaiting!"
There's no middle ground
^~^~^~^
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It's okay
Since it's fun, so it's whateverㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋ
