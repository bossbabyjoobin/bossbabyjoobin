What’s up?  
Are you sleeping??  
🫧 Maybe?  

^~^  
🫧 No, I’m waiting for you  

???  
You’ve changed  
Love  
How could it  
change so easily  
Hooㅜ…  
You were probably waiting though  
Heh  
I know everything  
`~~~~~ 
🫧 I regret not being able to show how much I liked JooBin in front of herㅠㅠ  

It’s okay  
I already knew  
just by looking at your eyes  
✨✨✨✨  
![[GXiA8-Cb0AA95gx.jpg|150]]  
Ta-da, here’s my new phone case  
I said I’d show you, right?  
How is it??!!?  
Isn’t it cute?  
Hehe  
I really like it  
🫧 It's a teddy bear case?  

Yeah,  
Teddy bear 1 is getting kissed by teddy bear 2.  
At first, I thought they were whispering,  
but then I realized their ears are way up there,  
so it must be a kiss.  
😚😚  
🫧 Is it like Hayeon kissing Bin or something?

..  
I got attacked a few days ago too  
🫧 Bin’s just like us, can’t say anything but really enjoys it hehe  

?  
WAVs should’ve seen my expression back then.  
Hehe  
🫧 That’s so Bin, acting like she doesn’t care but enjoying it the most  

That’s so WAV,  
you think I wouldn’t know?????  
🫧 Was Hayeon’s tongue joke funny?  

Not funny  
Well, it was okay  
But the situation Younji unnie kept bringing up  
wasn’t funny at all  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅌㄱㅌㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅌㅌ  
Meat is here!!  
Is it beef tongue??  
No, it’s obviously something else.  
We did this bit a hundred times,  
laughed all the way,  
and then Younji unnie kept going,  
“No, it’s always about beef tongueㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ”  
and saying weird stuff.  
It was tough yesterday...  
🫧 So, did you actually eat beef tongue? Hehe  

Yeah……  
🫧 You were the youngest at that table, huh?

Yeah…  
Jiwoo unnie from afar was like,  
“Bin is exhausted aloneㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ so calm.”  
She understood my feelings,  
I was so grateful……  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But then, I picked up the pace  
It was fun…  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Who was it again  
Soomin unnie?  
But Bin is definitely tired now,  
yet she’s enjoying it the most, that’s why she hasn’t gone back to the dorms yetㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
She said that while laughing hard  
And it seemed true  
Eh oh oh  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 See, pretending not to like it, but she does. So, would you rather live with Yeonji or Soomin?

I’ll live in a single room forever.  
Yesterday, I laughed so much I did an ab workout.  
Honestly,  
laughing at things  
that aren’t even funny,  
holding my stomach  
the entire time.  
🫧 Even just seeing beef tongue pass by would make you laugh now, huh?

If beef tongue was passing by, we’d have a problem…?  
  👀  
💪👅🤳  
   🦵🦵  
Is this right?  
That’d be a problem  
🫧 That looks just like Bin haha

? Should I say thank you or not  
Oh right  
Today  
Not really  
I bought a lot  
🫧 You changed your mind quickly ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

ㅎㅅㅎ  
Went shopping  
but didn’t really buy anything  
Not clothes or anything like that,  
just cute stuff  
gifts,  
snacks,  
bought lots of those.  
I found the cutest plushie.  
Anyone who sees it would think it’s cute  
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
I don’t know its name,  
but I fell in love at first sight.  
But it’s not a keychain,  
just a tiny plushie.  
So I searched for its home,  
went up and down the floors.  
Finally found its home  
and brought it with me.  
It was a rough journey,  
but I’m so proud.  
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹  
I’ll look for its name.  
But really, I’ve never seen it before.  
Oh  
I found it!!!!  
Obaken??!  
Obaken Baby  
A ghost and a rabbit.  
It’s seriously cuteㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
I attached it to my bag.  
A ghost!!  
Hehe  
Today,  
I also ate gyukatsu.  
It was seriously delicious.  
Had it with Yeonji unnie while sitting across from her hehe.  
Yeonji unnie,  
grilling her gyukatsu  
and drinking orange juice  
I took cute pictures of it ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
📸📸📸📸  
🫧 Yeonji was eyeing Bin’s seat, huh?

I was already there  
ㅇㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Does Bin take good pictures of other members? I remember Kotone saying she liked the vibe of photos Bin took of her.

Maybe because they like it, I take them well?? Hehe  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I like taking pictures of people.  
There’s something about the pictures I take  
and seeing the person like them  
that just makes me happy.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But I’m also picky ^~^  
Lighting, angle, natural light  
Backlight? Ah, not here.  
The background is kinda… pass.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Next time, can you take one of me too?💫

Leave it to me 😉📸  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
For now,  
I’ll go to sleep for tomorrow  
Ah, why are there typos like this  
For now,  
I’ll go to sleep for tomorrow  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Goodnight~~~
