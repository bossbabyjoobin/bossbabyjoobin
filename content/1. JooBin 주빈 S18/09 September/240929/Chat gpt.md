What are you doing?  
[Y/N] Hurry up and come out!  
!!!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
As soon as I changed my profile picture,  
you appeared.  
Hehe  
How is it?  
A fresh photo  
Taken just two hours ago!  
The concept is  
fairy vibes, you could say.  
^~^~^~^  
🫧 So that’s what a fairy looks like, huh? It’s my style??

ㅎㅅㅎ  
🫧 Binnie’s object is out tomorrow. I’m excited.  

It’s coming out tomorrow.  
Should I bring the picture or not?  
ㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ll think about it.  
🫧 Have you been practicing taking selfies, Binnie?  
The focus is a bit blurry ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  

^~*  
Today, I asked Seoyeon unnie for a selfie class again,  
and Seoyeon unnie was like, “Do you think I’m good at taking selfies?”  
So I said,  
“Yes.”  
ㅎㅎ  
She laughed,  
then suddenly filled my whole face on the phone screen and said,  
“You take it like this.”  
………….  
The class was canceled.  
🫧 But I like that “not-so-great” Binnie vibe... you know?

What do you mean… it’s not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not...  
Ah,  
it’s not blurry because of the quality,  
it’s originally blurry ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 How many things is Binnie bad at exactly~ You’re too precious.

? Isn’t it usually people who are good at things that are precious?  
Yesterday,  
I made zero chocolate bread,  
and Jiyeon unnie was like,  
“Wow, the smell is amazing..!!!!!!”  
And in my opinion,  
all my cooking  
smells incredible.  
The taste is a secret since only I try it,  
but the smell is fantastic.  
ㅋ  
According to Jiyeon unnie,  
it smells like freshly baked delicious chocolate bread from a bakery.  
🤓😉  
So I tried it today,  
it wasn’t bad,  
but I don’t think I’d make it again ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Almond cookies vs. zero chocolate bread showdown?

Personally,  
I vote for almond cookies.  
🫧 What did you eat today, Binnie?

Today,  
I had tofu inari sushi I made  
and yogurt.  
And today,  
Chaewon unnie  
bought me  
two protein shakes  
as a gift.  
I was so touched.  
🥲🥹🥹🥹🥹  
Actually, she said it looked tasty and asked me to try it and let her know if it was good.  
...  
So I said okay.  
The chocolate flavor was good, unnie…  
I’ll try the sweet potato flavor tomorrow…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 So what’s your late-night meal recommendation and tomorrow’s meal recommendation?

For a late-night meal,  
something spicy,  
like chicken feet,  
stir-fried pork,  
or mala xiang guo.  
ㅎㅎ  
And tomorrow’s meal recommendation is  
French toast!!!  
Or  
fried chicken in soy or spicy sauce, hehe.  
🫧 French toast!! Now you get it.

ㅎㅎ Learned it well.  
🫧 Classic Binnie. You eat something healthy, but recommend things that make WAVEs gain weight.

^^  
No, I recommend delicious things  
so you can eat tastier food than me.🫶🏻  
🫧 Binnie, soy sauce or spicy sauce for fried chicken?

Spicy sauce.  
But  
spicy is good,  
garlic soy sauce is good,  
cheese flavor is good too.  
Mixing them all together is the best ㅎ  
🫧 There she goes again, indecisive Binnie.

Hehe  
🫧 Okay, baby, what’s your favorite flavor of takoyaki?

Original takoyaki.  
But  
cheese flavor is also good.  
I just love cheese.  
🫧 You always recommend late-night snacks but brush your teeth and put on lip balm, so you don’t eat, right? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

^~* Exactly how I am right now.  
+ Too lazy, so I’m air-drying my hair.  
🫧 I’m really hungry, but it’s the middle of the night.

Here’s the solution:  
eat, then sleep later.  
✨✨✨✨✨✨  
It’s not a late-night meal anymore, just a meal 😋😋😋😋  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Oh, I’m chatting with Soomin unnie in between,  
so the conversation might stop and resume.  
.. ㅎㅎ  
We’re talking about Dubai,  
a cold,  
and galbi jjim.  
...  
🫧 Did you see “Binnie the Black-and-White Chef”?? It was so funny.

Uuuuuungggg!  
![[240929_S18_1.m4a]]  
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ  
I’m so hooked.  
Seoyeon unnie sent a moo sound,  
and I laughed.  
Something similar is even funnierㅜㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋ  
Buzz!  
^~^  
I turned it on while showering,  
now it’s waiting time...ㅠ  
Oh, I installed a waterproof phone holder for showers.  
😎  
It’s a life-saver.  
I set it up for everyone to use.  
🫧 Doesn’t that make your shower time longer? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

The time is the same,  
but I watch it after I get out,  
and while I dry my hair.  
That’s the difference.  
^~*  
When I’m fully ready for bed,  
it’s the perfect timing.  
Soomin unnie time has arrived.  
Soomin unnie resumed the concert today.  
It was kind of short,  
but it felt like a quick punch and exit.  
…ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
Soomin unnie time  
has ended.  
Thanks for that.  
…It’s over.  
🫧 Thank you, Binnie.

You’re welcome.  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Got any cool new items you bought recently?

Roasted eggs?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
How is it  
the teaser will be up again in 3 minutes.  
These days,  
without realizing,  
I’ve been singing VV’s song.  
Without even thinking,  
`~~~~~~`🎶🎶🎶🎶  
Wait, when did I start singing it?  
ㅎㅎ  
As a WAVE, I’m excited ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
Oh right, Sion unnie  
told me  
after work today  
to come over for some Dubai chocolate cake.  
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ I want to eat it so bad.  
I want to eat Dubai chocolate mochi too.  
Huh?  
I thought it was a puppy on my cheek,  
but  
it was a band.  
Mistyping… what’s going on?  
Yesterday, Jiyeon unnie and I  
counted how many VV teasers were coming out daily,  
and we were like,  
“Oh, is unnie coming out now?”  
And then we were like, “Wait, it’s already that time???”  
It’s so fast, but...  
we counted how many were left,  
and there’s still one more person left? ㅎㅎ  
And we both got awkward.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Finally,  
tomorrow’s the day it’s coming out.  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
Since I watched today’s teaser,  
I’ll go dry my hair now.  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
Bye  
![[240929_S18_2.m4a]]  
Love you🤍  
Goodnight
