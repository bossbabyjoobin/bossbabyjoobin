Sure! Here's the translation:

**[Audio Clip 1 & 2]**
What's up?  
I got ready for bed and now I'm lying down.  
I even set up a mood light.  
^~*  
But normally, I don't sleep this early.  
Why am I like this today?  
I was so tired that as soon as I got off work, I washed up and lay down.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
No, it's not that I'm struggling.  
I just went to Incheon and practiced, so my body was tired, so I'm just resting.  
🤸‍♀️🕺💃🤸‍♀️  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But seriously, I bought it thinking it was a mood light, but it's actually a real light.  
ㄹㅇ  
Super bright, like seriously shiny.  
So in an emergency fix, I layered two sheets of paper over it to block it.  
It’s less bright now, so it's fine.  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 JiwOO said the same thing; this is fate, Binnie.  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
From JiwOO unnie's colorful light to Binnie's shiny light, sigh.  
🫧 Does Binnie also sleep with the mood light on?

When I sleep, there can't be any light at all!  
!!!  
So I make sure to turn off all the lights and wear a sleep mask.  
🫧 Binnie, but try saying "mood light" out loud. It sounds funny—mood light, mood light.

**[Audio Clip 3]**
What? What's so funny about that?  
Eh? Am I the only one who doesn't get it?  
Why is everyone laughing?  
;;;;;  
🫧 Maybe they were just teasing you? ㅋㅋㅋ  

Ah-ha.!⭐️  
A deep realization.  
Huhuhuhu.  
🫧 바부바부바부바부바부부  

Our WAVs have such unique ways of showing affection ^~^~^  
Seriously, I just want to nibble on you! 🤍🤍  
^~^~^~^~^~^~^  
Biting is Seoyeon unnie’s way of showing affection.  
That's why I always wear long sleeves.  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 If she bites, it’s so fresh that fruit juice actually comes out.

? Oh, calling yourself fresh?  
Impressive.  
Respect.  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 What comes out when Binnie bites?

Probably blood.....?  
🫧 You're so confident! Go ahead, S25.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  
Congratulations ^|^  
Eh,  
^~^  
A weird typo came out.  
🫧 They say you knock on Sumin's door while she showers. ㅋㅋ

That was today.  
I was so tired that while I was working out, halfway through,  
I was like, "Hah... I'm exhausted."  
I leaned against the door, which happened to be the bathroom door.  
And then, boom!  
Aaaaaaaaahhh!!!  
I just passed out.  
But seriously, the first time it happened, I was so shocked.  
Outside, it sounded like someone was scratching the door.  
Like, bam, bam, bam!  
I thought someone was really trying to break down the door.  
I even turned off the shower because I was so scared.  
In my head, I was thinking, "This unnie is not only strange, she's terrifying."  
But when I asked after I finished showering, she just said she was bored.  
I thought, "She's really strange."  
I never imagined I would catch it too...  
🫧 What if it wasn't Sumin? Now that's truly terrifying.

Oh, that would give me chills!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But really, there are so many mysteries at the dorm.  
Things get knocked over even though no one touched them.  
One day, I put down my bag in the room, changed clothes,  
Then went back to my bed, and there were droplets of water on the floor.  
But no one had entered the room in that time.  
........  
So I thought it might have been water from the air conditioner,  
But the air conditioner and the wet part of the blanket weren't even close...  
Just another hidden mystery...  
🫧 That's me controlling a drone. ㅋ

Sure, sure. ㅋ  
🫧 I'll come solve the mystery for you.

Thanks! Is my love enough for the payment? 🤍🤍🤍🤍  
But seriously, it was scary.  
ㅎㅎ  
But there's no such thing as ghosts.  
What's scarier than ghosts is people...!!!!!  
Specifically Sumin unnie...!!!!!  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ah, I'm sleepy.  
Play word games with me.  
Start with [Y/N].  
🫧 Fool.

Barley rice.  
🫧 Dining table.

Scam.  
🫧 Hide and seek.

Goose.  
🫧 Train.

🫧 Ostrich.

I like you ㅋ  
Why the question mark?  
^~^  
`*^^*`  
That’s enough.  
I'm going to sleep. ㅋ  
I'll come at exactly 9.  
It’s a set answer anyway.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Any recommendations for tomorrow's menu?  
Cold soybean noodles!! Cold noodles!! Kimchi noodle soup!!  
Cool noodle dishes.  
Because the weather doesn’t feel like fall at all…  
How is this fall?!?  
I ate tuna kimbap today.  
I originally wanted cold soybean noodles, but  
I didn’t have the time to wait for them.  
My stomach was shouting,  
"Give me food now!!!!!!"  
So I calmed it down with kimbap. ^~^  
🫧 Did you finish a whole roll of kimbap this time?

I ate 75% of it.  
No, since I ate it with milk, I got full quickly.  
You know?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
No, it's fine.  
Surprisingly, it's not a bad combination.  
No, I didn’t dip it; I ate it separately.  
Now that I’m explaining kimbap and milk,  
Time has slipped away.  
;;;;;  
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’m not mentally sleepy, but my eyes are drowsy.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Alright, I’ll sleep.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
**[Audio Clip 4 & 5]**
