🫧 수민이 씻을때 너가 문 두들긴다던데 ㅋㅋ

그거 오늘이야
오늘 너무 피곤한데
운동을 하다가
중간에
흐아.. 힘들다
하고 기댔는데
화장실 문이라
그냥 기댄 김에
쿠구궁
으아아아ㅏ아ㅏ
이러고 지나감
근데 진심
처음 당했을 때 진짜 놀랐어
밖에서 손톱으로
쾅커ㅏㅇ커아드르르ㅡ르르르륵
이러니까
진짜 문 부시는 줄 알거
ㅈ진짜 기겁했어
샤워기도 무서워서 잠그고
진짜 속으로
이 언니 이상하다 못해 무섭다
이랬었는데
씻고 나가서 물어보니까 그냥 심심했다고 하길래
진짜 이상하다
했거든
전염될 줄은 꿈에도 몰랐죠…..
🫧 그거 수민이 아니래 이러면 진짜 공포

어후 진짜 소름끼침 그럼
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
근데 좀 숙소에
미스터리가
많아
아무도 뭘 안 했는데 뭐가 엎어져있거나
어느날은 또
내가 방에 가방 내려놓고
옷 갈아입고
다시 침대 쪽으로 왔는데
무슨 물방울이 막 떨어져있고
근데 그 사이에 방에 들어온 사람은 없었어
…….
그래서 에어컨에서 나온 물인가 했거든
근데 또 에어컨이랑 그 이불 젖어있는 부분이랑
가깝지도 않았어……
그런 숨겨진 미스터리……
🫧 그거 내가 드론으로 하는거야 ㅋ

이러네 ㅋ
🫧 i will come solve the mystery for you

Thanks Is my love enough for the payment?🤍🤍🤍🤍
아귿데 진짜
무서웠어 암튼
ㅎㅎ
그치만 귀신은 없어
귀신보다 무서운 건
사람이야…..!!!!!!
바로 수민언니..!!!!!

Just another story of SooMin terrorizing JooBin's peace 

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 SooMin said you knocked on the bathroom door while she was showeringㅋㅋ

That was today
I got tired in the middle of working out and leaned against something
but it turned out to be the bathroom door
But seriously, when it first happened
I was really surprised
From outside, there were these loud bangs and scratching noises, like someone using their fingernails
I seriously thought someone was trying to break down the door
I was really startled I even turned off the shower
In my mind, I was like "This unnie isn't just weird, she's scary"
After I finished washing up and asked about it, she said she was just bored
I thought "She's really weird" 
I never imagined it would happen to me too… 
🫧 What if SooMin said it wasn’t her? Now that’s really scary

I'm getting goosebumps
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But honestly, there are a lot of mysteries in our dorm
Things get knocked over when no one touches them
One day, I put my bag down in the room and changed clothes
When I came back to my bed, there were water droplets everywhere
But no one had entered the room during that time
…….
So I thought the water was from the AC
but the AC wasn’t even near the part of the blanket that was wet…
Such hidden mysteries…
It was really scary
ㅎㅎ
But there are no ghosts
What’s scarier than ghosts is people…..!!!!!!
and that's SooMin unnie..!!!!!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
