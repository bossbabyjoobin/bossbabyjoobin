Here's the translation for you:

[Y/N] What are you up to?  
Come out!  
Did you have a good Chuseok?  
I had a good time toooo  
I ate some *songpyeon*  
🍡😚😚😚  
And had galbi too  
Hehe  
It’s been a while since I’ve had homemade Korean food,  
It was really good.  
But I got tired again,  
So I passed out after eating  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bin, did you watch Idol Star Athletics Championships?

Yeah, I watched it with my family.  
I saw Nakyung unnie, Ka-e unnie, and Shinwi unnie doing breaking dance  
And I covered my eyes when I saw myself on screen here and there ^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I was fully focused  
😟 I had this expression  
🫧 Did you see the drama teaser with Seoyeon?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Yeah, I saw it.  
I didn’t know what it was about, but  
I thought it suited her really well.  
While watching the trailer,  
I was like, wow…  
I’m looking forward to it too.  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But as I watched,  
Hamham unnie kept overlapping with her.  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ🐹🐹  
Summer unnie… Seoyeon unnie..? Summer unnie…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hehe  
Not long left now.  
I’m going to have to watch it too.  
It looks like it’ll be fun.  
Heh  
🫧 My summer is you, Bin-ah~

My summer is WAV~~~~~  
🫧 Bin-chan looks like she’d be good at acting too.

But I’ve never done it before, though  
🫧 Who did you take purikura with?

Oh, I took them with  
Tonae unnie, Seoyeon unnie, Soomin unnie, Sion unnie, and Chaewon unnie.  
✌️✌️✌️  
But  
Purikura is really something else.  
You only get one chance to take the picture…  
Luckily, the unnies were like, "This!! Next!!"  
They were really good at it, so  
It was fine.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Japan’s sticker pictures really made your eyes look big, didn’t they?ㅎㅎㅎ

It was shocking...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
My eyes were like BOOM!!!!  
It was so funny but also cute.  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Oh, and seriously,  
I suddenly want to talk about this, but  
I was really touched by Jiyun unnie’s dance sport.  
I almost cried.  
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹  
How  
Can a person be so graceful,  
Like a human swan?  
I was really serious.  
Whew...  
🫧 It was sad when Jiyun cried ㅠㅠ

ㅠㅠㅠㅠ She was the most elegant person in the world, so why cry, Jinjjang...  
When Seoyeon unnie comforted her,  
I was next to them,  
But I couldn’t say anything, just 🥺 like this...  
Unnie, it’s okay… You did amazing, so why are you crying for real?  
🫧 Bin, your running was the most inspiring to me.

Are you serious?  
Thank you ^~*  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
Enough.  
🫧 But you ran better than I expected. I thought you’d be in the 30-second range.

...Excuse me?  
Huh?  
Uh?  
What?  
🫧 You came back so much faster than I expected, I almost cried.

...You were moved in a different way.  
That’s good...right?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But seriously,  
Watching the unnies shine,  
I fell for them all over again that day...  
The dance sport,  
All the unnies were so cool.  
And Yuyeon unnie’s archery  
Honestly, it shocked me.  
She was so good.  
10!!!!  
23 people  
"WOW!!!!!"  
And it just kept going like that.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bin, are you originally good at sports?

..  
I feel like I proved it, but  
No, not really.  
ㅎㅎ  
VM1  
🫧 Things Bin isn’t good at:  
1. Cooking  
2. Sports (NEW!!!)

What is this?  
Get it out of here.  
I don’t need it!  
!!!!!!!!  
😤😤😤😤😤  
🫧 3. Comedy

What’s that?  
What is this?  
Next year, I’ll do all three well.  
..  
Oh.  
Do I only need to do one well?  
Well, I already did it then.  
Since I’m good at cooking,  
That’s that!  
🫧 Wow, you’re unexpectedly funny.

Oh, now two are cleared!!  
ㅎㅎ  
What?  
Why?  
Hahaha  
Thanks.  
🫧 You’re so shameless, I think you’d be good at comedy... but why aren’t you funny?

What does it matter?  
I made WAV laugh just now ^~^~^~^  
🫧 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ This is why I like you, Bin^^

I know, I know ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ🤍  
🫧 Why is it only WAV trying to tease you in Bin’s FROMs?

It’s a bit of a mystery.  
It’s love❤️ㅎㅎ  
They tease me because they like me, duhㅋ  
VM2  
🫧 Haha, right right.

What’s with the awkward "haha" before that?  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
Alright,  
Surprise sudden food recommendation!!  
*tteokbokki*  
❤️❤️❤️  
With cheese,  
Add *gimbap,*  
Add fried dumplings.  
I’m usually a rice cake (*tteok*) person, but  
For some reason, I feel like recommending wheat cakes right now.  
🫧 What is this, are you Yeo Ahjung?? You added so much stuff.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Jiyun says she’s never tried Yeo Ahjung. Do you like it, Bin?

I haven’t tried it either.  
But it must be good, right?  
🫧 Bin, are you going to start working out again?

I did today.  
🫧 So when are you going to work out with Sion?

I’ll do it alone, thanks.  
Save me.  
Woaaaah.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 That’s a Signal feeling right there.

That’s kinda risky.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Soomin says she likes you these days. How’d you do that?

Oh yeah, I did it again..  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
Well, the other day,  
Jiyun unnie  
Told me I was a charming person (*bolmae*).  
Now I’m just showing everyone else that charm⸜(♡’ᗜ‘♡)⸝  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hehehe  
I think it’s just because our room is fun.  
Actually, I’m going to name our room.  
Soomin unnie, Bin, Seolrin unnie, Jiyun unnie…  
*Seolbing-soo*  
It’s tough.  
My name automatically gets *bingsoo.*  
Let’s put it on hold.  
If I get a brilliant idea later,  
I’ll decide then.  
???? Really???  
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!  
Awesome.  
How  
Goosebumps, that’s amazing.  
No, seriously,ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
Watching the teaser,  
In our room,  
We were all like, “How… She’s so pretty… Our unnies… So coolㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ.”  
And then Jiyun unnie went, “What? Did it come out?!!”  
And I was like, unnie, seriously🥺 what do we do, you’re so pretty.  
And she went, “Ah!!! Why are you like this!!!”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I was like, “How… Even though they’re our members... they’re just so pretty...”  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
And Jiyun unnie went, “STOP!!!!”  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hehe  
Still fangirling over Vivi  
But seriously,  
So pretty.  
Ah...  
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
I’m going to go to sleep now.  
Gonna calm down and sleep.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hehe
