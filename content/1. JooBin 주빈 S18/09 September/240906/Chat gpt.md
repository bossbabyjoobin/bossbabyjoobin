It’s too late
ㅎㅎ
I just came in late today
Because of the members' live, washing up, and stuff like that
🫧 Binnie, what did you have for dinner?

I had kimbap for lunch and dinner
🫧 Are you having a late-night snack now?

No, I'm trying not to eat again.. 
Digestive issues
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 If you ever want ramen as a late-night snack, try adding vinegar. It helps lower blood sugar, so it's somewhat better.

..?
At that point,
It’s better not to eat, right?
I'm more of a jjapagetti person than a ramen person
I haven’t had ramen in 
How many years?
Anyway, it’s been a while.
I’m sleepy today, but 
I thought of [Y/N], so I stopped by for a bit
Let's chat longer next time
I'll stay for just a little bit longer
Hehe
There was practice since this morning
But it's okay
Very healthy..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Oh right
I thought of my late-night meal suggestion for today and tomorrow 
Cold soba, cold soybean soup noodles, and sweet and spicy chicken
They’re just some foods that came to mind today
🫧 Yeonji said she had cold soba today, what’s up with you two?

Oh really??
I didn’t meet Yeonji unnie today
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I’m weak for the Yeonji-Joobin combo on WAV

It’s a combo that
Takes the attention
Kwac-jup
🫧 Is it kwac-jupz?

I’m not sure, 
I just said it randomly
ㅎㅎ
🫧 School is tough. Please give me some encouraging words.

Since you have to go anyway
You might as well embrace it..
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 It’s already Friday~~~The week went by so fast.

Oh
I kind of
Lose track of
What day it is..
I didn’t know it was Friday
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 But for some reason, I hate Fridays lately because it means Monday is coming soon.

No way
Let’s enjoy Friday
That way it’s a bit less hard
To face Monday
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Euuuaaargh
Now, I’m going to head
To dreamland 
For tomorrow's
Journey
⸜(♡’ᗜ‘♡)⸝
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Bye-bye
