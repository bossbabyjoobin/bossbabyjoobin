Helo  
Guess who  
Try and guess  
🫧 TripleS?

You got it...  
🫧 Seems like a cute friend, but who is it? 🤍🤍

Oh dear, haha  
![[240923_S18_2.m4a]]  
Got caught! Haha  
WeiBu (fan group) sense is sharp  
🫧 It's definitely not Bini

Hey there  
Shh  
^~^~^~^  
Today, I  
went through so many trials  
ㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜ  
I'll shape those trials and become better~~  
🫧 Alright, tell me one by one, I'll listen ^~^

Today  
I tried to eat healthy,  
but I faced trials like tteokbokki, mala soup, chocolate cake, and bubble tea.  
Hooㅜ  
ㅠㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ  
🫧 Did you eat all of that?

Not exactly, I almost gave up  
I ignored it  
Being with the members is the worst condition for dieting  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 So what did you eat? Salad?

I had steamed veggies and meat  
+` cherry tomatoes  
I bought 1kg of cherry tomatoes  
Luckily, if I give one to each member, 24 will be gone  
Today, I gave one to Seoyeon unnie and said,  
"Unnie, this is really tasty, try one."  
She said it was good  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
😚😚  
Do you like Hae-mi unnie the most? ㅋㅋㅋ  
I told you  
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I mean, 국밥 (Korean soup with rice)  
If it’s soup + rice, of course I’ve had it.  
Though I’ve never ordered 국밥 as a menu item,  
but I said, "if you put rice in soup, it’s basically the same."  
Chaewon unnie got really mad,  
"Bini!  
How can that be the same?  
Putting rice in any soup isn’t 국밥, it has its own flavor!!!"  
So I apologized and asked for recommendations next time.  
She accepted the apology with a relaxed expression.  
Oops, auto-correct...  
허허...  
Please understand ㅎ  
🫧 That sounded a lot like So-hyun from Fromis just now...ㅎㅎ

Does So-hyun unnie end her sentences with "Thank you"?  
🫧 She does make a lot of auto-correct mistakes though

앜ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Actually, I have the same issue with auto-correct  
When I text my friends,  
auto-correct messes up a lot.  
But now, they’re used to it and understand.  
🫧 So that means you’re careful when sending messages to Fromis?

ㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ that’s right.  
There are so many,  
sometimes I just delete and resend them.  
⸜(♡’ᗜ‘♡)⸝  
Even now, it’s auto-correct.  
Once, I made a mistake, but it fit the flow so well,  
I just pretended nothing happened.  
^~*  
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 It’s okay, I’ll try to understand the context from now on, Sal-burger.

Got it, fried-noodles.  
🫧 Still, ^~^, you type that by hand, right?

Yeah, I type that by hand.  
Because  
^~^  
^~^~^~^  
^~*  
When the situation calls for it,  
I have to choose the right one and type it.  
It’s a form of customization.  
It’s comfortable since I’m used to it.  
^~^~^~^~^~^~^  
🫧 You type each one manually? That’s dedication.

It’s my love  
for WeiBu.  
❤️  
^~*  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I can’t keep up with your typing speed.

My nails have gotten longer, so I’m a bit slower,  
I often erase typos and rewrite.  
But I’m still pretty fast.  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bini, are you good at typing without looking?

Hmm,  
let me try.  
WeiBu fool ㅋ  
Oh,  
I’m really good at it!  
^^  
🫧 Try doing S1 through S24!

Challenge accepted.  
Yoon Seoyeon, Jeong Hae-rin, Lee Ji-woo, Kim Chae-yeon, Kim Yoo-yeon, Kim Na-kyung, Gong Yoo-bin, Kaede, Seo Da-hyun, Kotone, Kwak Yeon-ji, Nien, Park So-hyun, Shin Wi, Mayu, Lin, Joo-bin, Jung Ha-yeon, Park Si-on, Kim Chae-won, Seol-lin, Soo-ah, Ji-yeon  
Wow  
Wow  
!!!!!!!!!!  
![[240923_S18_3.m4a]]  
Wow,  
I was a bit nervous  
because if I messed up a name, I’d feel bad.  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
Now it’s a skill: typing all 24 names without a typo while blindfolded.  
What do you think?  
🫧 You know you’ll mess up if you actually try, right?

… Correct.  
Why?  
Did I mess up??  
Oh no  
……  
Big trouble.  
Keep it a secret.  
Well, if someone memorizes all 24 names  
blindfolded, it’s actually harder.  
You get what I mean, right?  
Now I’m making more typos than when I had my eyes open,  
you know what I mean, right?  
I mean…  
no…  
…  
I wasn’t actually unsure.  
I was testing you, WeiBu. You know what I mean, right?  
It was like a surprise test  
to see if you’d catch on.  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㄹㄹㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 I challenge you: say all the members’ names in a voice message.

Okay!  
![[240923_S18_4.m4a]]  
..  
It’s hard ㅎ  
Soo-min unnie,  
Soo-min unnie,  
you know what I mean, right? It’s not like that.  
ㅇㅋ?  
WeiBu,  
you’re amazing...  
I’m realizing that again.  
WeiBu, you’re the best...  
The cheering chants are really tough...  
🫧 We do that plus dance and rap too, you know. 

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Fighting!  
One and twenty-four!!  
Girls never die!!!!!  
🫧 Kwak Yeon-ji and Kim Chae-won: disappointed.

I love you🤍🤍🤍🤍  
Soo-min unnie too🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍  
I really 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍  
love you🤍🤍🤍🤍  
😚  
WeiBu,  
do you know what “keeping a secret” means?  
Oh, you don’t?  
🫧 I know what “revealing a secret” means though…

It’s the exact opposite of that.  
You don’t know?  
Well...  
🫧 What do you think would happen if Soo-min found out about this?

..  
She’d accept it as a cute mistake from a cute little sister.  
Heh  
❤️🫶🏻❤️🫶🏻❤️🫶🏻  
And in this case?  
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️✨  
Ooooh,  
it’s been a while since the fairy appeared  
The fairy’s been busy, it seems.  
🫧 She probably went on summer vacation🫠🫠🫠

That’s what I thought.  
She’s back now that it’s fall.  
I’ll pass on the fairy’s recommendations for tomorrow’s meal:  
Pork cutlet!!  
Sweet and sour chicken!!  
🫧 What will you eat?

I’m going to make banana pancakes.  
A recipe with a 2% chance of failure.  
Just mix bananas and eggs  
and cook it!  
🫧 You’re amazing to beat that 2% chance.

I haven’t even made it yet,  
but thanks.  
🫧 Should I try making pudding?

Pudding isn’t really my style.  
🫧 So you mix bananas and eggs, cook it, and then burn it?

No, I didn’t burn it!  
I’ll make it tomorrow.  
I’ve made it before,  
and it turned out really well.  
ㅋ  
🫧 Can I have a bite instead of cookies?

There’s no space left.  
Eat the cookies too.  
But the banana pancake is tastier.  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
🫧 Chae-won said that

 Soo-min’s diet cookies taste bad and make you lose your appetite, saying they’re the same as Bini’s.

..  
Mine are tastier.  
They’re filled with love.  
🫧 It’s touching to see you trying so hard even in areas you’re not good at. 🥹

...?  
I’m glad I could touch your heart, [Y/N].  
🫧 Did you see the teaser for NaKi?

Yup.  
Isn’t it so cute?  
🐱 Just like that  
round-eyed cat picture.  
Personally, I think the VVs (members) look great with short hair.  
They can pull off anything.  
🥹🥹🥹  
🫧 If you could change your hairstyle, what would you do?

I’d go for Rapunzel.  
Rapunzel~~~~~  
Let down your hair~~~~~~~~  
🫧 Won’t it take a day to dry your hair? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Oh no,  
it already takes long enough,  
I’m canceling Rapunzel.  
I’ll be Belle instead, from *Beauty and the Beast*.  
🫧 The doorbell?

…No.  
I meant Belle’s lovely wavy hair.  
That’s what I’ll do.  
Jingle Bells—  
Are you talking about Annabelle?!  
Oh dear...  
WeiBu,  
your sense of humor ^~^  
where will it go next, I wonder? Haha  
I’m going to bed.  
Dream of me.
