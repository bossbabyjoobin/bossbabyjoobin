The day I heard a hundred times that I look like a brown Maltese + Poodle

Actually, behind the scenes of those pictures
I was so tired that I was just sitting there with this facial expression 🙂
Then suddenly, I saw the camera from afar
so I started waving a peace sign like 😊😊😊😊😊
and that’s how the pictures turned out

JooBin's siblings fall victim to her passion for baking cookies (Again) but WAVs aren't falling for it 

#JooBin #주빈


I’ve made cookies twice today  
Currently baking more cookies
It's almond cookies
I let my younger siblings try one each
Review 1: “It kinda tastes like pumpkin..? The aftertaste is a little bitter”  
Review 2: (munches) “I don’t want any more”  
(munches) “I finished it all”  

From the second review, when my sibling ate the whole thing
I asked “How is it?!”  
But then she said “Unnie, I think you should try something different next time”  
She said it in such an innocent tone [t/n: her siblings are young btw, both in elementary]
It made me feel even more sorry...  
But really, in my opinion
It tasted good 
I swear it’s actually good
🫧 They say people tend to like what they make themselves

Ahhh ㅎㅎ 
But really, this one is good
First 100 WAVs will receive free cookies
It's first come, first served
Come eat them up ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
😋😋😋  
I’m serious, it’s actually good💖  
I’m making more right now too
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
`VM: No, seriously, It's really good`
Considering it’s a diet recipe, it’s really tasty
Or maybe it’s because I had it after eating a salad...???  
But seriously, it tastes good
It’s made entirely with almond flour and all you taste is that sweet, roasted almond flavor
🫧 Your siblings probably didn't take into account that it's diet cookies, right?  

Honestly, I didn’t tell them that
Maybe that’s why…  
🫧 But you know, it is kind of sad when a cookie doesn’t have chocolate chips

Even my siblings were like “Wait, is this a recipe where you’re not supposed to add chocolate chips??”  
So I just told them "Just eat it"  
^~^~^~^~^  
My mistake ㅎㅎ
Oh well, It can't be helped
🫧 Binnie, I miss you

Me too  
I’ll bring almond cookies, let's meet  
🫧 Binnie… please stop cooking… 😞😞😞

Don’t block the path of an aspiring chef!  
ㅋ
🫧 Forget about the cookies, let’s just meet…ㅎㅎ

I’m bringing cookies, you cannot refuse
^~*  
2 minutes until the next batch of cookies is ready  ㅎㅎㅎ
Yey one minute left
🫧 Oh no, I’m looking for the next victim! 

Eheyyyy
It’s a gift
🎁🎁🎁🎁

Cookie disaster Pt. 1

Jeong HaYeon's ulterior motive in MODU HAUS and the birth of SulBingSooJi and their respective roles 

#JooBin #주빈


`[t/n: this is not the first time HaYeon did this btw, check the tweet below ^^~]`

Earlier, HaYeon unnie said she was bored being alone
so she came over to our HAUS and kept lying on the sofa 
Then she saw me washing tomatoes and said
🦔“Hmm… I want some tomatoesㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ"  
🐣"Will 10 be enough??”  
🦔 "Yes hehehehehe" 
So I washed the tomatoes and gave it to her
She said they were good and ate them all
Oh and before she left, she also ate Sullin unnie’s Shine Muscat 
🫧 She wasn’t bored, she was just hungry??

Ah, that was it 
I’ve been tricked…  
🫧 So what’s the name of your room?

SulBinSooJi (KR: **설빙수지**) <sup>[(_설_린, 주_빈_, _수_민, _지_연) fka as "OnBinSooDa" and "BinSooOnDa"]</sup>
<sup>[Also, Sulbing (설빙) is a popular dessert café chain famous for Bingsu. Sulbing Bingsu 설빙 (빙)수 (this works too), just a wild guess since Binnie didn't specify what it meant, it's just the combination of their names really]</sup>
I kind of made it up on my own 
🫧 What are the roles in your room?

SooMin unnie holds concerts
The rest of us just live our daily lives
🫧 But do you actually call your rooms by their given names?

We just name it and that was it ㅎㅎ
I’m in charge of being the exhausted audience at the concert, cheering until I get tired 
Sullin unnie blocks it out with her AirPods  
JiYeon unnie leaves the room and stays in the living room
🫧 So it’s really like a solo concert just for Binnie?

…Oh… that’s actually nice!  <sup>[t/n: ye right...😭🤣😂]</sup>
🫧 I’m jealous, is there an empty bed in your room?

ㅠㅠㅠㅠ No, there’s not 
Do you want my spot?  
🫧 No, you should sleep there

Okay  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Almost moved my bed to the sofa
🫧 But you can sleep well in that room?

It’s quiet when we sleep  
🫧 Are you a light sleeper or a heavy sleeper, Binnie?

Honestly, I used to be the type of person who’d keep sleeping even if there was a fire 
I was seriously worried back then, no joke
But after moving into the house
I’ve become really sensitive to sound
I guess it’s adaptation?  
🫧 Is it because you’re tense?

At first, yes
But now, maybe I’m subconsciously tense
because I can hear everything clearly
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 But now you have your tent, right?

Oh yeah 
The tent is like the first layer of soundproofing…  
It does that job well so I’m fine

You can kinda see why the other members decided not to live in the dorms. You really can’t blame them — it's not for everyone. I’m glad JooBin's adjusted to it by now (hopefully.. ㅠㅠ)
