Girlfriend appearance  
ㅋㅋ  
What do you think?  
🫧 You actually pulled off this handmade filter...  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Pulling this off  
After the live  
I washed up  
I'm back  
🫧 It’s just... a bit... lovable...?  

😉  
🫧 By the way, I watched the live while wearing a neon green outfit...  

ㅇ오, cool  
I filmed shorts today  
It’s a secret  
But I’m telling you anyway  
Just keep it to yourself~~~  
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
🫧 Today’s Yeongji was cute too 🍒🍿🤍🤍  

Thank you 🤍  
🫧 Bin is really good at drawing!  

What did you think of my filter?  
Before the live,  
I prepared thoroughly  
^~*  
🫧 Honestly, it was pretty high-quality  

Heh  
🫧 The filter Bin drew is fun! Please draw another one next time💖  

🥕Consider it done  
🫧 It seemed like I quickly cut it with scissors, but it fit Bin's face perfectly, so it was amazing ✨️✨️😢  

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋ  
For the first filter, I crumpled and ripped it by hand ㅎㅎ  
🫧 You did great with the hosting today!  

Is this what they call the MC skills of JooManSa?  
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩  
I still have a long way to go,  
But I’m rolling forward somehow~~  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I was a bit disappointed there wasn’t a JooManSa Wave episode observation diary today  

???: Well, WAV must’ve watched TripleS videos, right..?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Our Bin has grown up so much.. I practically raised you...  

Huh? I don’t remember being carried, but okay  
🫧 Bin, by the way, do you know Bangga Bangga HamTori?  

No, but someone showed me a meme after the show  
Then I went, "Ah, this one!"  
I’ve seen that hamster many times  
But I didn’t know it was  
Called Bangga Bangga HamTori...  
🫧 Did you think it was Ebichu?  

Ooooh  
I think so  
I must’ve thought that  
Honestly, there are just too many orange hamsters, so I got confused  
If Ebichu looks kind of simple,  
HamTori has a bit of a twinkle in its eyes  
That kind of vibe  
Okay  
Earlier, did you try Yamechu?  
Did you eat it??  
I’m asking because I feel like you didn’t ㅎㅎ  
🫧 yes! (no)  

Caught red-handed  
🫧 Since it’s Bin’s recommendation, of course I didn’t eat it  

That’s kind of contradictory, isn’t it?  
🫧 Bin, by the way, when you laugh, it’s really like ^~^ << this, it’s so cuteㅋㅋ  

Huh?  
^~^ Not sure  
^~^ I use it so often  
Even when talking with my friends  
I use it  
I even use it with my parents  
^|^  
Oops  
^~^  
With my friends,  
I say  
What’s up ^~^~^~^  
To my mom,  
Mom, I want to eat tteokgalbi ^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 That’s both a bit frustrating but cute—did you plan that?  

Correct! ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Bin, I’m really thankful you come to *from* every night. It gives me strength every day.  

Noooo  
It’s become part of my nightly routine  
That’s how comfortable it is  
It’s like I just naturally seek it out  
You know?!!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
My precious waves  
🌊🌊🌊  
Oh, and  
I sent some Marine-look photos  
On SNS  
^~*  
However  
The queue  
Is expected to be quite long  
So wait for it..  
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
🫧 Use a magic pass  

Unfortunately,  
There’s none…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I need to dry my hair, but I’m too lazy  

I’m drying mine right now  
🫧 I’m blinking one eye at a time while doing *from* ㅎㅎ  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I need to sleep too  
Tomorrow  
No, today  
I need to go out early!!  
🤸‍♀️🕺💃🤸‍♀️💃🕺  
Phew  
I’ll leave in 2 minutes  
🫧 You’re leaving quite energetically  

If your heart isn’t excited,  
At least your body should be.. `^~^~*~^`  
Haha  
Positivity loop  
Through actions  
Putting it into practice  
In front of the members  
There was a slightly disappointing situation last time or something,  
But I was like, "It’s okay.. At least I have more time to prepare by getting there early."  
Then someone—  
Was it Dahyun unnie? Or Soomin unnie?  
Said, “Bin is so positive…”  
Positive thinking!!!!  
And that’s how  
Even if it’s just a little bit,  
You feel like your happiness level  
Goes up  
Feels good  
Now I’m going to sleep  
!!!!
