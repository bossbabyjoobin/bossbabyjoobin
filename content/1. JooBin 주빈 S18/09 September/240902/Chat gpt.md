Wave  
What’s up? Did you have dinner??  
I ate a bit early.  
Had yukhoe bibimbap with Hayeon unnie.  
Yum.  
🫧 Bin’s solo live tomorrow!!!!! Can’t wait for it!

Right?  
I just found out today too..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What are you going to talk about during the live?

I’m not sure.  
What should we do?  
Cooking? Mukbang? Counseling? Just say it all.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 How about Joomansa during the live?

This time’s guest is...  
Wave!!  
Please give a quick self-introduction ^~^  
As for the live,  
I guess tomorrow’s me will handle it somehow.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hyerin unnie and Tone unnie said they want to be the next guests on Joomansa.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 By the way, doesn’t it seem like Kotone really likes you these days?

No way, she’s always liked me ㅎㅅㅎ  
Oh, by the way, I’m just really curious.  
Around July, did I send you photos from the Marine Chic fan signing?  
No?  
Ah, but I did send two videos.  
Okay, I was just asking because I saw them while organizing my gallery.  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ll come back after the live tomorrow.  
Heh.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Let’s move on ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I was going to work out, but since Bin showed up, I couldn’t. Totally your fault, Bin.

What are you talking about?  
I worked out too!  
Go work out quickly.  
That’s just an excuse.  
These days,  
Soomin unnie and I help each other stay healthy without even saying a word.  
...  
If one of us says,  
“I don’t want to work out,”  
The other will say, “Just do it, you have to anyway.”  
🫧 Soomin isn’t talkative?

Ah, let me take that back.  
Anyway, we do help each other verbally. Something like that? ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 So, Bin, can you recommend a dress code for the live tomorrow?

Is Wave doing a live too?  
Is it a joint live?  
Wear something neon green, please.  
^~*  
🫧 But I’m a guest on Joomansa!

Ah, right. I forgot.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Not even a firefly would wear neon green...

Even a firefly wouldn’t wear something like that if you asked.  
🫧 Then are you going to wear neon green too?

Eh, no?  
I’m going to wear something pretty.  
ㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
[Y/N]!!!  
I remembered something to recommend for tomorrow:  
Yubuchobap!  
I used to eat it all the time with the unnies back then, but it suddenly came to mind.  
Fat yubu!  
It’s the big yubuchobap with lots of toppings!  
!!!  
🫧 Have you ever tried tofu yubu?

Yeah, I really like it.  
🫧 Does yubuchobap have toppings?

It’s like scrambled eggs, tuna mayo, yukhoe, beef bulgogi, things like that.  
🫧 I think you said you ate it on Signal too 🙂‍↕️

Yes, but that was a small one.  
There’s a big one with different toppings on it.  
I prefer the big ones 👻👻👻  
🫧 How many fat yubus can you eat?

Three??..!!  
🫧 Wow, that’s more than I thought.

I eat a lot selectively.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
If I like it, I eat well.  
If I don’t like it, I just fill my stomach.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Everyone’s like that~~~~  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I don’t even know what food Bin really likes.

Sweet, nutty, soft, chewy.  
Is that too broad?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 If you wouldn’t gain weight, name five foods you’d eat endlessly.

Bread, rice cakes, fruit, milk, ice cream.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
If weight didn’t matter.  
If it does, then homemade meals are the best.  
^~^  
Bread is  
something I can never give up in my life..  
Like how Wave is a special presence..✨✨  
ㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Sneakily mentioning us to make us feel good, huh?

(How did you know?)  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
You figured it out well ^~^~^~^  
🫧 I’m home, but I want to go home 😢

I get that.  
At times like that,  
watch your favorite movie,  
eat your favorite food,  
turn on the AC, and wrap yourself in a blanket,  
and you’ll feel warm inside.  
🫧 What does that even mean?

Don’t ruin the moment.  
Shh.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Being with Bin on From is true happiness 🤍

How romantic, Wave.  
🤩🤍🤍  
🫧 Isn’t it warm even if you turn on the AC and block it with a box?

?  
Why block it with a box...  
Use a blanket…  
Or a throw…  
🫧 Then why turn it on...

Aha!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Let’s just sleep  
😴😴😴😴😴  
But recently,  
even though it’s already autumn,  
it was so hot that I wanted something cold,  
so I had a strawberry latte,  
something I hadn’t had in ages.  
!!!!  
🍓🥛😚😚😚  
It was as delicious as ever.  
Phew.  
And today…  
I had strawberry bingsu with Hayeon unnie.  
Wow, it was so good.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ히히  
As expected, delicious.  
🫧 Bin, can I ask why you like strawberry lattes but not strawberry milk?

Strawberry milk  
tastes a bit artificial.  
I’m not a fan of strawberry ice cream either.  
But oddly enough, I do like artificial banana milk.  
It’s just a matter of preference ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Have you tried strawberry-banana or chocolate-banana milk?

Chocolate-banana is  
really good.  
I haven’t had it since elementary school,  
but it’s still good.  
It’s like,  
sweet + sweet.  
The sweet flavors of chocolate and banana combined…  
🫧 Do you like mango, Bin?

I only like mango juice.  
Hmm, that sounds strange too.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Frozen mango, fresh mango, no.  
Apple mango, good.  
Mango juice, mango yogurt, good.  
Mango jam, no.  
I guess it’s just my preference,  
but who knows?  
^~*  
🫧 You like artificial but not artificial flavors...

Yeah..  
🫧 So, it’s a mix of factory and natural tastes?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’m not really into dried mango either,  
but dried strawberries are tasty.  
...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Just eat whatever you want, Wave..  
ㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 We always eat what we want.

Oh, really?  
Well,  
I guess so..?  
Yeah..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I’m eating your love  

Thanks~  
Huh?  
[Y/N], are you okay??????  
Did you just fall to the floor?  
Are you hurt??????  
ㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
Why would I be hurt?  
I just dropped my phone.  
Snap out of it, Wave..  
ㅋ  
🫧 Where am I?

Welcome to Bin's From World ~~~~~~ ^~^  
🫧 I tripped on the street so you wouldn’t feel awkward, but then you reacted like that....

...Even if you trip, I can’t see you.. Why did you trip?  
Get up even if you fall ~~~~~~~  
🫧 Are you going to do a filter show on Instagram Live tomorrow too??

Too predictable.  
I’m going down a different path.  
I’ll draw them myself.  
Handmade filters.  
Ah, don’t expect much,  
just acknowledge it.  
ㅎㅎ  
Now,  
I’m going to prepare for tomorrow’s live.  
Actually, I’m just sleepy ^~*  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ헤헿  
Oh no,  
Seolyn unnie is tempting me with dakgangjeong.  
Tonight’s late-night snack recommendation is dakgangjeong.  
But I’ve already applied lip balm.  
I’m going to sleep now…  
Phew.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
