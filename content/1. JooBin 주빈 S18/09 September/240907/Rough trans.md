Daegu festival ended up being like a water festival due to the rain  

#JooBin #주빈 

Hi WAV 
🌊🌊🌊  
How’s your day going?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
WAVs we met in Daegu
We all got soaked from the rain
Me too...  
My hair is still damp...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Even Binnie got drenched ㅠ  

But it was fun, we really enjoyed it
Singing with the unnies in the rain
 *bibaram jom deo sege* <sup>[KR: 비바람 좀 더 세게 | EN: The Stronger The Rain  – Rising Lyrics]</sup>
It was kinda funny
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
After the stage, everyone was like "Woahhhh"
Saying "Good job, everyone"  
"Let’s record a video to remember how we got rained on!" 
Everyone’s just like "Let’s do it!" 
Oh and while we were wrapping up after the stage
I kept singing Chiyu and endlessly repeating the chorus
*Fallin’ in the water*~~
*Divin’ under water*~~
*I will come down as rain…… now..* 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
tripleS has something with water
It’s inevitable
Water.. Rain and Wind.. Wave..<sup>[물 Water <sup>(In Chiyu)</sup> | 비바람 Rain and wind <sup>(In Rising)</sup> | 파도 Wave <sup>(WAV🌊)</sup>]</sup>

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I thought the stage would be slippery but no one slipped. That's impressive 😢

Fortunately, all the members finished the performance safely
Thanks to WAVs' cheers, we were able to enjoy the stage even in the rain~
This was the first time we've performed in the rain
But I think doing it once in a while is actually nice ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 It was also my first time watching a performance in the rain..

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Doing something like this for the first time with WAVs…….
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ🤍🤍
🫧 Now, isn't it going to rain everywhere JooBin goes?

Hold on
I take that back
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 They say teams that get rained on end up being really successful

Oh really..???
Maybe I don’t need to take it back ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ


For context on the Rising lyrics above -> 00:17. It’s like the lyrics turned into reality, poor hamham 🐹
