Sorry for being lateㅎ  
VM

Will it surpass the great Artist Jeong?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I’m out for a walkㅎㅎ

Aren’t you hot?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I missed Binnie, so I’m binge-watching Joomansaㅎㅎ  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hmm  
Will she appear again?  
I don’t know  
I didn’t say anything  
🫧 Just one hint for the next guest  

Hmm  
Should I give it or not  
🫧 Modhaus, are you watching? Here, over here  

Ah, I really can’t give it..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
ㅇㅋ  
The full name has a 'K'  
ㅎㅎ  
There are too many~~~~~~~~  
🫧 ..... There’s Kim... and Tohne... and Kae too...  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Possibilities are no limit~~~~~  
🫧 Kim Chaeyeon, Kim Yuyeon, Kim Sumin, Kim Nakyung, Gong Yoobin, Kaede, Kotone, Kwak Yeonji, Mayu, Rin, Kim Chaewon...

I missed that  
🫧 How are more than half of the members with a ‘K’  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I don’t know, moving on  
ㅋ  
And  
No  
A mistake

I can’t say  
But you know  
There’s something like that~~~~~~~~~  
There’s so much I want to send  
Good luck with the guessing!! ^~^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Do you have any behind-the-scenes for this objekt?  

This time  
Um  
Ah  
During filming  
We were doing a variety of poses  
They told me, “Binna, do it boldly!!”  
So I responded, “Yes!” and did it as boldly as I could  
But  
They said, “Binna, the members in front of you  
have done everything—running, sitting, rolling  
It’s okay, go for it”  
So I thought  
……. What is this?  
With that thought in mind  
I made a resolution to practice more bold poses next time…  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binna, you should’ve boldly done a handstand  

🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️  
It’s tough.  
🫧 The first object to show just feet  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  
📸🦶  
So legendary  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But actually  
I haven’t dried my hair  
ASMR of drying hair  
Starting with essence  
Wait  
VM  
Now lower the volume  
VM  
🫧 I don’t want to  

..ㅇㅋ  
If your ears hurt  
I’m not responsible.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ah  
Before I go  
I’ll give lots of recommendations  
OGW  
Today’s snack recommendation ^~*  
Kkobuk chips.. Choco chip cookies..  
Sounds delicious  
And  
Tomorrow’s meal recommendation  
Donkatsu & soba  
Wooaahhh  
The best  
🫧 Tomorrow’s to-do list recommendation  

Think about JooBim?  
🫧 No recommendation for Kkobuk chip flavor?  

Actually, I really like the chocolate churros flavor  
But today’s recommendation is  
Original  
Corn soup flavor  
🫧 Oh, it wasn’t the choco chip cookie flavor for Kkobuk chips?  

ㅇㅓ  
I mentioned two  
ㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Don’t you get your mouth hurt if you eat a lot of Kkobuk chips?  

Really?  
I guess I haven’t eaten that much…  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅅㅋㄱㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Now I’m going
