Hey!
Why aren't you sleeping!!
🫧 I was literally just about to fall asleep, wow

Did I wake you up??
Don’t wait for me..
But I’m glad we can chat though, haha
ㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I have to wake up at 5 for work, so I want to keep talking with you, but I really need to sleep early today....

ㅠㅠㅜㅜ Okay, sleep well
I’ll try to come a bit earlier tomorrow
Hehe
Today, 
I had pigtails
🫧 Why aren’t you sleeping, Bini?.? 

I couldn’t sleep well on the bus
I might just pass out when I arrive
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You were so cute that I screamed in Seoul, did you hear me?

Oh, so that was you
No wonder it was so loud
I was a bit surprised
🫧 Twin tails suit you too well

Thank you🤍
🫧 I screamed from the Philippines, did you hear that??

Whoa
Ah, so that was the other scream I heard
No wonder it was so clear
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I took a lot of photos
I’ll bring them with me
🫧 I liked the photos of Joobin that were posted on the group account today too

Attack!!!!
I was wondering what to title it and then
I just went with
Joobin Attack!!!!
🫧 This makes me feel even closer to you

Ah, seriously
Of course, you’d say that.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Have you ever actually said "Joobin" out loud?

Yeah
Just now
I tried it
Joobin!
🫧 Who’s sitting next to you right now?

Next to me
is something small but big
cute but pretty
My bag is sitting here!
I always miss the mark, huh..
Sigh..
ㅋㅋㅌㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I want to send Joobin flying away

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Bag, you’re cute and pretty

Actually, it’s not
It’s just big
A carrier bag
You know?
🫧 "Dad is entering the room" vs. "Dad is entering the bag"

Those always showed up as examples for spacing in textbooks..
“Dad is entering the room.” 👨🚪
“Dad is entering the bag.” 👨👜
Every time I saw that
I thought of my dad and
ran a simulation in my head
imagine him entering the room
and entering a bag
at the same time
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’m listening to music
as I’m on my way
My playlist right now is
“Off My Face”
It’s calm and nice
Yeah
By Justin Bieber!
🫧 What is your favorite tripleS song?

These days I believe it's "Hash ###"
Lately, I listen to
"Hash" a lot
How should I put it
When I listen to it, it feels just the right amount of upbeat and fun
But when I’m dancing
It’s like, “Oh, it’s too fast, no, this isn’t it”
That kind of thought?
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Compliment me, I memorized the lyrics to "Hash"

Are you Japanese?
I didn’t know the lyrics’ meaning
so when I was recording
I kept asking the Japanese members
What’s this?
And this…?
And this….?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
The older girls taught me everything
Wow~!!!
That’s cool…
But the fact that I had to ask the Japanese about Japanese…
It’s cool
🫧 Joobin is an idiot (if you look closely, it looks like “I love you”)

No matter how closely you look,
it just looks like Joobin is an idiot
Even from afar, it’s still the same, huh?
…..
🫧 Correct!

What do you mean correct, the correct answer is
WAV is an idiot idiot idiot
If you look closely
it might look like WAV, I love you~~~~
🫧 Still can’t see it

Ah, close!
^~^~^~^~^~
Yeah, I love you ㅎㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
That’s just how much I love you~~~~~
You know that, right?
ㅎㅅㅎ
🫧 What did you eat at the rest stop?

Bead ice cream🍦
Actually, I was going to get a cone, but
Chaewon unnie was like
No, not the cone, you know Mongji? Yeah
So I decided on bead ice cream.
🫧 What’s your favorite bead ice cream flavor, Bini?

Banana Spli-ee-it
🫧 Bini, our generation eats Bibi-bik

I eat Bibi-bik too
It’s tasty
But when I choose Bibi-bik when buying ice cream
people around me
🤨🤨🤨🤨
look at me like that
..
It’s delicious though
🫧 What about Joobin’s eyes?

😙😉😋
I mean, do you know that shaved ice ice cream??
It’s got milk flavor, red bean flavor, and condensed milk flavor all inside
And it’s already made
It’s in bar form
Not the one in the container
🫧 Bingbing

Is that it???
That’s right, that’s right!!!
It’s tasty
And the bar-shaped shaved ice with red beans and milk is also good
Here's the translation:

---

🫧 What’s your favorite ice cream, Bini?

Bbangddoa.. Chalddok Ice Cream.. World Cone.. Yomamte..
Somewhere around there….
🫧 Did you know Chalddok Ice Cream used to have three pieces in it, Joobin?

??????????
Really????
That’s crazy
Why did they reduce it?
🫧 Inflation

..That’s a spot-on answer
🫧 What’s your favorite Baskin-Robbins flavor?

Hmm, for Baskin-Robbins,
Mom is an Alien, New York Cheesecake, Yogurt Bongbong, Oreo,
Black Sorbet are delicious,
but once I was eating it in a cone
and spilled it all over my white clothes,
so now I only eat it at home
or I don’t eat it at all…
The clothes
turned black in just a second
………
And this happened while I was on my way to take a photo in the photo booth……
I remember wearing an outer layer just for the photo…
I do eat Shooting Star, Cotton Candy Wonderland..
but I don’t go out of my way to eat them.
It feels more like my sibling’s pick than mine..?
I don’t seek out mint choco, but I can eat it
🫧 You have a sibling..?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I haven’t mentioned this?
Hehe
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I do have one
`~~~~~~~`
🫧 I thought you were an only child

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Younger brother?? Younger sister??

Both!!
🫧 Do your siblings also have to endure your terrible jokes..? Poor them

? No
What are you talking about
How are they terrible jokes
Explain yourself
^~^
🫧 So, your siblings have also suffered from your cooking disasters?

Yeah
My siblings are better at cooking than me
..
My sibling made me a meal,
and I gave them a burnt cookie in return..
After they tried it,
they went straight to the sink
and spit it out..
They even started singing….
The cookie that unnie made~~~~~~
It’s not tasty
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
After that, whenever I ask if I should bake something,
they’re like, “You’re not going to burn it like last time, are you? It’s okay, you don’t have to”
……
Even a baby wouldn’t find it tasty……
So I’ve decided not to try making cookies again ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Should Bini develop another hobby..?

…. Okay
🫧 No, don’t give up! Fighting, always

Yeah! ㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Was the food your sibling made good?

Oh, they’re good at it
They must take after mom
🫧 Who do you take after, Bini…..

A mutant……
🫧 If you tested it on Sion, wouldn’t she eat it somehow? Sion never refuses cookies

No, remember that powder cookie mix I made a while ago?
She rejected that on the first try
The powder cookies I made on Signal
But honestly, that wasn’t my fault
The powder cookies just didn’t taste good
You know?
You know, right?
Don’t you?
🫧 Those are supposed to taste bad ㅋㅋㅋ

Exactly
It couldn’t be helped
!
🫧 Do you start to feel rebellious if you follow the recipe exactly?

No, it’s not like that
You know how they say there’s a personal touch to cooking?
And they say starting is half the battle
So I just started it
but I couldn’t stop
and just went all the way to the end
Something like that?
🫧 They say half the battle is staying still, does that mean Joobin stays still?

..
Yes!
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Bini, recommend me something to eat for tomorrow…
I have to be on the bus for 5 hours 🥹

Huh
Rolled omelet and inari sushi
Omurice?
Soba?
Tonkatsu?
If I keep going, I’ll list every food
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Eat them all
🫧 Bini, by the way…
I got into you in the middle of everything, so
is there a hashtag I can search for Bini…?
I want to post something you can see.. but I can’t find one
Ah, the food hashtag!! is
맛집줍줍 (MatjipJubJub)
For letters,
내_편지를_받아줍 (Nae_Pyeonjireul_Badajub)
!!!
But actually, I read everything posted on FROM too
So just post it wherever’s convenient
If you can’t remember either hashtag
Just
send it on FROM
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Bini, I love you

Me too🤍🤍🤍
🫧 Did you see what I sent yesterday?

🥕 Before coming today, you sent something too
I saw everything before coming
🫧 Can you say the tongue twister "Police Station Bars" for me?

It was in a letter, right?
I was
touched
laughed
replied out loud to myself
and laughed again
That’s how it was..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Do you like writing letters, Bini??

Yeah
It feels like I can pour my true feelings into words
I like writing and stuff like that
🫧 Then write us a letter sometime too

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌYeah~~~~
I’ll bring it, look forward to it
🫧 I’m already crying, okay

? I haven’t even sent it yet
ㅔ
……
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I wrote it down in my daily to-do list
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’m going to sleep now
See you tomorrow
!!!
Love you
The members are sleeping
so I can’t send a voice message
But I love you
Goodnight
`~~~~~~`
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
![[240814_1.m4a]] Not sure if you can hear this, but
Goodnight
🤍🤍🤍
See you tomorrow!! ❤️
Bye-bye
