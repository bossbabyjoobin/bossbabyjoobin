As much as she loves her TMT unnies, JooBin still wouldn't want to be their roommate

#JooBin #주빈

I kind of... chatting on fromm
While reacting to everything SooMin unnie was saying next to me
It felt a bit weird
….  
SooMin unnie said she’s studying Japanese  
So I casually said "Fighting"  
She said "It’s nothing special ㅋ"  
"Sutaa sutaa watashi wa sutaa"  <sup>[Lyrics from Mamushi by Megan Thee Stallion]</sup>
"Ka Ki Ku Ke Ko"  <sup>[Japanese Kana]</sup>
"Gee gee gee gee baby baby baby"  <sup>[SNSD - Gee |  this idk, It's not even in JP in the JP ver 😂]</sup>
She’s doing all that
Isn't it understandable that I'm a bit confused..?
What is she talking about?  
That’s the point…  
I don’t know either…  

🫧 You're not very good at the whole "in one ear and out the other" skill, are you?

Before I can let something go out the other ear
Something else keeps coming in 
Nonstop
......  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
You’re really good at picking things up on your own, aren't you? 
That’s what I'm thinking
Cool unnie  
❤️  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 If YeonJi and SooMin were roommates, that room would definitely explode for sure

It's fine as long as I'm not there
