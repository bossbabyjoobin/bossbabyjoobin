Hi  
!!!!!  
I'm using my tent  
so perfectly and practically.  
It's so cozy….🤍  

🫧 You, who comes right after watching JooManSa. You’ve got some sense.  

I kind of do ㅎ  
I watched JooManSa while showering.  
휴휴  
🫧 Will the air conditioner come back on?  

That's why I'm inside the tent.  
I found and removed the cause of last night's issue.  
The cause was some box blocking something or whatever.  
Anyway, it's cool now ㅎㅎ  
💨💨💨💨💨💨  
🫧 I haven't watched JooManSa yet, I'm saving it. Can you tell me the key points?  

Can you handle it if I spoil everything?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Key points:  
Binie's face and energy getting more and more exhausted…  
And,  
Alright, I won’t spoil it ㅎ  
I actually talked about Yeonji unnie's stories  
like 15 times more than that,  
but it seems like it got cut due to length…  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 By the way, how long did the filming take?  

I don’t remember,  
but I was fine at the start,  
by the end, my legs were giving out?  
Something like that? ㅎㅎ  

🫧 To be honest, did you get distracted in the middle or not?  

..didn't.. I?  
Hmm no.  

🫧 After JooManSa filming, did you shoot that Signal application shorts that came out before?  

I think it was shot before.  
So in that shorts,  
the energy’s kinda fine  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 Bin-ah, since it's come to this, can you spoil the next JooManSa episode?  

It's a real secret, but should I tell you?  
I already filmed it.  
So,  
I thought the guest for episode 5  
would appear in episode 4.  
I didn't know today would be Yeonji unnie…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 Then is the K you spoiled last time the guest for episode 5?  

Bingo.. but episode 4 guest Kwak Yeonji unnie  
is also Kwak  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 Bin-ah, did you see the photos with Yeonji on Cosmo?  
They’re so pretty!  

Behind that Polaroid,  
all the photos,  
we were holding back laughter.  
Suddenly, Yeonji unnie said,  
"I’ve been thinking about this thumbnail!"  
So I was like,  
Huh..??????  
"Bin-ah, sit down."  
Okay  
*Bang, snap, click*  

🫧 Isn’t that the ending from Ulsan?ㅋㄱㄲ?  

Yup..  
So  
we turned around,  
and burst into laughter.  
Ahㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
Like that,  
*Focus, you can do it.*  
*Pfft* (click)  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 I can’t take it anymore! I'm going to watch JooManSa right now.  

As expected  
It’s hard to save JooManSa for later.  
I watched it as soon as it came out too  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Will there come a day when we WAVs see Binie do that pose?  

..Who knows..?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 I wanted to see Joobin in person at today’s event, but it’s a shame ㅜㅜ  

It’s okay,  
there will be  
so many  
opportunities in the future.  
Oh, there’s something I wanted to say.  
For the past  
30 minutes  
before you came,  
this thought was spinning in my head:  
WAVs are fools.  
The more I look at you...  
I miss you..✨✨✨✨✨✨✨  

🫧 I know, sorry for being a fool....

Huh  
ㅇㅋ  
Just keep being a fool  
ㅋ  

🫧 Binie is a fool.  
Just a fool.  

Hey you, come here.
🫧 Are we fools because Bini is a fool..? They say fans resemble their idols.

What’s this, I said something sentimental,  
and you immediately came back with “fool” and “백하” (백=100)?  
;  
Unbelievable  
^~*  
Two fools  

🫧 Bibo is a good place to live.

Bibobibo  
Beep bo beep bo  
Beeeeepooo  
Bop beep bop beep bo  
Sorryㅎ  

🫧 Is that Soomin by any chance?

Next to me  
Next to me,  
going "parapara ppukkappukka"  
So after hearing it for a while,  
I’m unconsciously getting sucked in.  
What should I do?  

🫧 These days, it seems like Binnie has a lot of festival schedules.

With TripleS,  
a nationwide tour!!!  

🫧 When you go to the provinces, do you try local delicacies?

I’d like to, but  
there’s no time.  
While moving with the members,  
we still eat something delicious together, though.  
[Y/N]!!!  
I’ve found  
the perfect solution  
to a life that’s not boring enough  
to overcome laziness.  
Wanna know?  
I’ll tell you.  
It’s a rhetorical question.  
Just listen  
;  
It’s…  
working out.  
As a breathing exercise master,  
I hadn’t looked into other exercises, but…  
Lately, I’ve been losing energy, so  
I’ve been working out,  
though honestly, it feels like I’m still losing strength.  
But well, I guess it'll get better eventually…  
With that mindset,  
I work out every day.  
It’s so hard.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 Is it just the dumbbell lifts from JooManSa?

It’s more than that ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I miss you.  

🫧 I miss you too.

Ah, not you  
^^  
I miss Jiwoo unnie~~~~  
ㅋ  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Just kidding ㅎㅎ  
I miss [Y/N]🤍🤍🤍  
I miss [Y/N]!!!!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 No, it’s fine, I miss Jiwoo too.

Oh.. okay, let’s call it even.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I feel like  
doing FROM  
while reacting to everything  
Soomin unnie says  
next to me  
makes things feel weird  
….  
Soomin unnie said she’s studying Japanese,  
so I casually said, "Fighting!"  
but it’s no big deal ㅋ  
"Sutaa sutaa watashi wa sutaa"  <sup>[Lyrics in Megan Thee Stallion - Mamushi]</sup>
"Ka Ki Ku Ke Ko"  <sup>[Japanese Kana]</sup>
"Gee gee gee gee baby baby baby"  <sup>[SNSD - Gee, It's not even in JP in the JP ver 😂]</sup>
She’s doing that
Isn’t it reasonable for me to feel a bit dazed..?  
ㅎㅎhoho  
What am I talking about?  
That’s the point…  
I don’t know either…  

🫧 You’re not good at the skill of listening in one ear and letting it out the other, huh?

Before I can listen in one ear and let it out the other,  
something keeps coming in  
non-stop  
......  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
She's like, "Your absorption skill is no joke."  
Cool unnie  
❤️  
ㅎㅎ  

🫧 If Yeonji and Soomin were roommates, that room would explode.

It’s fine as long as I’m not there ㄷ  

🫧 It’d be funny if Binie ended up like that after a few months.

I’m actually thinking, "What if that really happens?"  
^~^~^  

🫧 Wasn’t Binie already the leader of the '07 line?

? I’m from ‘09 though?  

🫧 Who’s the member with the most similar energy to you?

Hmm  
Hmm  
Hmm  
Hmm  
…  
I don’t know….  

🫧 It's a good thing you’re not living with Xinyu.

..She’s in the living room, though?  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 Normally, but suddenly going high when things get weird

Kind of like Jiwoo unnie, Jiyeon unnie, Lin unnie, Kae unnie  
Somewhere in that mix  
Hehe  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
When I’m on FROM,  
I try to talk a lot,  
You know why?  
Because in reality, I can’t keep up with the energy,  
so at least my fingers are working hard,  
that’s what it is  
^~*  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Binnie, are you fast at typing?

Somewhat fast?  
🫧 But do you prefer being called Bina! by fans or Joobin-a!?  
Not Jyoobim-a!, just Bini.

Bina  
somehow  
sounds  
easy to listen to.  
Bina, you know?  
Heck  
Heh  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What happens if we don’t call you anything?

I didn’t see that coming.  
🫧 Oh, and the first wave came out!! Can you give a little spoiler about the concept?

Ah, right.  
The group photo was uploaded.  
It’s kind of  
like a pizza shop worker-style  
outfit.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What’s your favorite pizza?

Ah, this is tricky.  
I eat everything well.  
Gorgonzola  
Margherita  
Bulgogi  
Hawaiian  
Sweet Potato  
Steak  
These are the pizzas I usually eat.  
🍕🍕🍕  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But I eat cheese pizza the most often,  
I don’t really have a preference for or against anything.  
I just eat whatever the person I’m with wants to eat.  
Anything~~~~  
Last time,  
I went on a date with Tone unnie  
to see the Sanrio characters,  
and we ate sweet potato pizza.  
Unnie wanted to eat it, but I like it too,  
so it’s actually nice.  

🫧 Who’s your favorite Sanrio character?

Pochacco!!  
🫧 Are you the type to try new menu items when they come out, or do you usually stick to what you know?

When it comes to ice cream,  
I always try new things,  
but my mom would ask why I keep trying strange stuff.  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 I commend your adventurous spirit.

Thanksㅎㅎ  
🫧 What should I eat as a late-night snack this weekend?

Galbijjim.  
Oops.  
Galbijjim (braised short ribs).  
Dahyun unnie ordered it last time,  
and today I was craving it so much,  
so I ate it today.  
🫧 It’s finally time for me to try something Bini recommends.

ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bina,  
chocolate milk vs strawberry milk vs banana milk?

White milk.  
Yum.  
1st place: White milk  
2nd place: Banana milk  
3rd place: Chocolate milk  
🫧 Soy milk?

These days, I only drink soy milkkk.  
Soy milk is tasty.  
I like both nutty  
and sweet flavors.  
🫧 Is there a flavor you don’t like?

Wasabi flavor…?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Because it’s spicy?

That sharp flavor.  
I don’t like it.  
It stings.  
🫧 Do you dislike the wasabi that comes with sushi too?

I don’t eat sushi either ㅎ  
The only sushi I eat is:  
Inari sushi (sweet tofu wrap sushi),  
cooked beef sushi.  
^~^  
I’ve never been able to eat sashimi,  
ever since I tried salmon once.  
I haven’t tried it again.  
Is there an easier sashimi to try?  
Hmm  
Ah,  
Okay,  
I’ve heard white fish  
is good to try first.  
But  
I do eat yukhoe (raw beef).  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I didn’t even used to eat yukhoe,  
but there’s a reason I started.  
It’s a bit funny.  
When I was younger, we went to a BBQ restaurant,  
and you know those small, thin slices of yukhoe?  
Whenever I saw yukhoe, I’d be like “ugh, I won’t eat that.”  
But my younger sibling was eating it so deliciously,  
and said, "Unnie, I’ll grill this little one for you."  
So they actually grilled it for me.  
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So after I tried that, it was okay,  
and then I tried a small piece of raw yukhoe,  
and from then on, I kept trying it,  
and now I like it.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It just tastes like meat.  
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Talking about food makes me hungry…

In that case,  
power brushing!!!  
Apply lip balm, wear a sleep mask,  
and dive into bed.  
Oh, are you already eating..?  
Well then…  
Enjoy your  
delicious late-night snack.ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Okay, fake hunger.  
Think of a food you don’t like,  
and if you say, “I want to eat that,”  
then it’s real hunger.  
If not, it’s fake.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 But I can’t resist.  
🫧 I’ll just eat and gain weight.

Yeah, just  
eat…  
I’m going to sleep.  
^~*  
![[240831_1.m4a]] 30 minutes later,  
It’s autumn…  
🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁  
You worked hard in August,  
and let’s get through September well, too.  
🤍ㅇ🤍  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Bye  
Good night.
