Heyyyyy  
[Y/N]!!  
I’m here!!!  
I’m here!!  
Hehe  
🫧 Why didn’t you come yesterday?

Yesterday  
Schedule issues..!!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’m so sleepy right now  
So I came a bit early  
^~*  
Right?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 It was so hard without you yesterdayㅠㅠㅠ

That’s why I’m here  
🫧 You did great at the fan meet today!!! I really want to hear your thoughts on completing your first promotion!!

Ah ah, mic test  
Okay, I’ll start  
First of all!! Time flew by so fast that it still doesn’t feel real  
When the music show ended, I kept wondering when it would be over, and then it just ended all at once, which was a bit disappointing  
The fan sign felt similar  
Before the first fan sign, I was so nervous that I couldn’t even smile properly, and I was worried about what to say  
But now that I’m used to meeting WAVs, and time has passed quickly, I feel really sad that it’s the last one…  
But..!!!  
There are still a lot of events and schedules coming up  
So I believe we’ll keep seeing each other~~~  
So don’t be sad  
🥹  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I don’t know when the next promotion will be, so I’ll stay on my toes  
🫧 This reminds me of how nervous you were at the startㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Noooo  
Even your smile was awkward at first  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Suddenly feeling proud...

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But time really does fly  
We debuted as a full group in the spring  
And now it’s already summer  
The hottest days are over, and soon it’ll be fall  
🫧 Four months until our next debut’s first anniversary

No way.?.?.?.???  
I still can’t believe half a year has passed  
No way  
🫢🫢🫢🫢  
🫧 Time is passing way too quickly

I know right…  
It’s okay  
We’ll keep seeing each other  
for a long, long time  
So please keep supporting us  
😉  
🫧 Now that there are no more fan signs, what are you doing tomorrow?

Even without fan signs, there’s still stuff~~~  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Please film Signal and JooManSa soonㅋㅋ

I’m filming them whenever I have time  
I should also check out the observation journal  
But actually  
I can’t observe the members anymore  
Everyone knows when the filming is happening now  
The ones involved  
They find out  
ㅜ  
If I have to inform them about the filming…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So I was observing hard before the schedule was announced  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 If you were the one being observed, what do you think would be written down?

Lives only in the living room and bedroom  
Sleep talks  
Cooks well  
Something like that?  
What  
Why  
No questions allowed.  
🫧 Needs to be revised to "cooks well"

ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅌㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅌㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Cooking..well-cooking...  
🫧 Master of evasion  
VM  
🫧 Are you totally serious with us but really funny with the members?

But if I say that  
It’s kind of awkward..  
But it’s true  
Hehe  
😉  
🕺💃🕺💃  
No questions, remember.  
^~^~^~^~^~^  
Ah, how do I even prove this  
🫧 Make us laugh

You know, it’s that thing?  
When you’re asked to do something, you suddenly can’t  
So  
I don’t think I can make you laugh  
It’s a shame  
ㅎㅎ  
If a bird falls while flying?  
It’d be dangerous, not "nakgopsae"  
^^  
The bird is hurt right now  
Can you really laugh?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It’s funny, right? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
How was that?  
🫧 Uh… It was fun… I like it...

Where’s the soul in that..?  
🫧 I think Nakgopsae was funnier

Oh no  
Getting beaten by WAV  
;;;;  
It’s okay  
It’s possible to lose  
!  
VM  
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 This is so random, but when you talk to Seollyn, do you speak in Korean or English?

These days, Seollyn unnie’s Korean is so good  
So I just go for Korean  
We can communicate fine  
I only use English when explaining something important, I guess  
🫧 Is there a language you want to learn, besides Japanese?

Um  
Spanish  
If we exclude English, Chinese, and Japanese  
Then Spanish  
But even if you send me something in Spanish, I wouldn’t understand  
..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Why did you choose English as the first foreign language to learn?

Since I was young  
I just liked English  
Actually, I don’t remember the exact reason  
But once I started learning, it was fun  
So I kept going  
I also liked Chinese, so I learned that too when I was young  
Learning languages  
was fun for me  
Like it was shaping my identity  
ㅋㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So in elementary school  
I was the Chinese class rep.  
I did all my Chinese homework  
And won the speed reading contest  
So I became the class rep.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I didn’t do my homework, so could you maybe give me the answers???

When friends ask me like this  
I can’t say no  
But then I think I’ll get in trouble if I help  
So I’m like.. um  
Here.. in the book.. here here  
I point with my finger  
Tap tap tap  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Did you finish your homework right away or did you procrastinate?

I’d finish the subjects I liked or the easy ones first  
Then procrastinate until the deadline  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Ever done last-minute diary writing?

I did it once, never again…  
Eventually, I ended up writing shorter and shorter entries  
Then my teacher said, “Oh, the entries got really short near the end~”  
It’s a disaster if you let it pile up….  
ㅋㅋㅋ  
I don’t write diaries now  
But  
Sometimes I jot down memorable things  
Not daily, just when I feel like it  
The most recent was  
when we had a schedule in Japan on the 24th!!  
I wrote down my excited feelings about going to Japan  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Now I’m gonna  
go to bed  
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴  
See you tomorrow  
VM  
I’m so sleepy, I’m diving into bed  
Ba-bye  
VM  
Bye!!!  
🤍
