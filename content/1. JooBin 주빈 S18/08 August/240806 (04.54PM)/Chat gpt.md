**Translation:**

Hi
You were thinking, "Bin is here at such an early time?"
You totally caught me
ㅎㅅㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Yeah, it’s me
No
It's because doing something different is
refreshing and fun
VM
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Did you eat, baby?

I haven't had dinner yet
[Y/N] Did you have dinner??
🫧 I didn't even have lunch..

?????
I'll suggest something for dinner
Hmm
It's been a while since I suggested something before dinner
Samgyeopsal with doenjang jjigae
I said it, and it's amazing
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Samgyeopsal with doenjang jjigae? You’ve got good taste

^~^ I know
Actually, you need to have it with steamed eggs and rice too
🫧 This is really random, but I miss you, Bin

It’s really random, but it feels nice
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’m hungry
🫧 Ugh, I just woke up ㅋㅋㅋ

?
If you just woke up,
when do you sleep..?
I’m going to have milk and bread? Hotdog?
Hehe
🫧 My day starts when Bin comes

So your day started every day at dawn…
🫧 Chatting with Bin at night is my routine, but today it might get broken

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Sometimes breaking the routine
isn’t a bad thing
🫧 Wow, chatting with Bin is making me sleepy all of a sudden, what should I do?

? What, am I a specialist in treating insomnia?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 The power of change is incredible

JooBim!!!!!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I need to decide on a JooBim pose now

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋ Sounds good
🫧 JooBim (∩^o^)⊃━☆ﾟ.*･｡ Abracadabra!

That’s cute
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Joobin-ah, it looks like there’s something behind you?

It’s just the wall
ㅋ
🫧 Bin-ah, I’m so hot I feel like I’m melting

I agree
This weather is melting everything
VM
Hmm~~~~
The milk is refreshing
VM
I can’t hear a thing..
ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It’s cheese bread
🫧 It sounds like you’re munching on something

Noㅠ you can’t hear it
Okay, second ASMR
VM
It’s a hotdog
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Joobin, just one bite

Open wide
🫧 When did making eating sounds become ASMR..

?
It’s ASMR
🫧 Bin, you’re not cut out for ASMR..

..
🫧 What does the hotdog taste like?

Sour, sweet, yum yum, chew chew
Something like that?
Ah
Original
🫧 Hmm, your flavor descriptions are a bit lacking

..
Forget it!!!!
ㅋㅋㅅㅋㄱㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I don’t care anymore
It’s tasty, so that’s enough
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Bin is the best, ASMR is the best

A bit more enthusiasm, please
^~^
Thank you ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Soomin unnie
is sitting in front of me
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋ
She’s telling a story
Last night
she was reading
and got sleepy
so she slept
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋ
Why is everyone surprised that Soomin unnie was reading?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 What was Bin’s response to that?

Munch munch oh really? Munch munch oh, munch munch ah
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Do you and Soomin have a duo name?

Jack and the Beanstalk, but with “Mung”
I don’t even know
The reason for “Mung”
It just is
Unnie decided
Enjoy your meal, the end
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 How can you just have a hotdog for dinner?

I’m full
🫧 Bin, let me clock out…

That’s beyond my abilities
🫧 Bin, let me see you...

✌🏻(>~<)
🫧 Why are you acting cute, Bin?

It’s not an act, I am cute! ㅎㅎ
What do you mean “Ehng”?
🫧 Your cheekiness has really increased

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ
JooMC’s growth result
`=`
More cheeky
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
JooCheeky
🫧 Ms. JooCheeky, what are your plans for the rest of the day?

I’m planning to think about WAVs
then wash up
and sleep
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I’m also planning to think about myself a bit, then wash up and sleep, we’re in sync

..^~^
No need to sync up on everything like this
ㅎㅎㅎ허헐허허라럴
🫧 Wow, you look so pretty today, Bin

? Are you looking at me?
Wrong
Right now
I’m sitting on
a chair, not on the
bed or
sofa
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
If you lie down after eating, you’ll get indigestion
🫧 Indigestion can be fixed by going to the hospital, but happiness is hard to find no matter where you go

..That’s a cool thought
🫧 Why is Bin so cute today?

No way
You can’t even see me
Everyone’s been complimenting me a lot when I’m not visible…..?
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Thank you
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Why is Bin so cute today?

? Come here
🫧 I’m in a state of exhaustion
I’m the 15th patient waiting at the hospital
When will it be my turn?

ㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Such an interesting thought…
WAVs, in my opinion,
are all masters of witty banter
They’re just hiding it
🫧 Now we just need one more person to become a master of witty banter…

.
It’s you, it’s you
It’s you, I’m talking about
Oh
Ice cream
🫧 I knew it, we just needed one more master of witty banter...

…….?
Alright
I’m leaving
🫧 Bin, was my banter only funny to me?

..
You changed your stance really quickly..?
ㅋㅌㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Hey.. no matter what, lying is a bit....ㄹ

?
I think
WAVs enjoy teasing me
during these chats
^~^
Is that right?
ㅋㅋㄱㅌㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 But Bin, isn’t it the same for you?

Hehe
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
VM
🫧 Wait, was this a live chat from Bin? I’ve been catching up on two days’ worth for the last 10 minutes, wondering why it hasn’t ended

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It’s too early to say goodnight, but
Goodnight ㅎ
VM
Bye bye
🤍
Love you
VM
