심지어 손톱이 있으면 불편한 게 아니라
네일아트를 하면 불편한 걸 텐데
그렇대………

Chaos ensues in MODU HAUS late at night and JooBin's top 3 hardest members to deal with

#JooBin #주빈



In our room, SooMin unnie and Sullin unnie were just looking at each other
and then suddenly started yelling
"Thai Princess ~~~~~~ "
"Ah ~~~~~~ "
Like this and kept going
Then SooMin unnie started talking about something, saying that nail art is uncomfortable  
And then she said
“No, it’s uncomfortable just having fingers"
?
"Oh, I mean nails \~~~~~ "
Her daily life is kind of like a sitcom…  
It’s not even that having nails is uncomfortable  
It’s that doing nail art is uncomfortable
That's what she said………
🫧 HaeSol manager is amazing. I’d probably quit being the manager in just one day

ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I think it would be tough for me too...
🫧 Who do you think are the top 3 hardest members to handle?

First is SooMin unnie
Second is Xinyu unnie
Third… 
Third is SeoAh
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 So it’s like your first, second and third favorite, right?

..
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Surprisingly, HaYeon isn't on the list ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Honestly, I debated between HaYeon and ChaeWon unnie
but since both are hard to handle
I just chose cutie SeoAh
🫧 What rank is YeonJi?

YeonJi unnie talks… a loooot especially when she’s chatting with the members
So I don't think she’d be hard to handle
Or maybe…
I kinda want to take that back now

🫧 서아 요즘도 빈이보면 돌진해?

당연한소리
돌진보단 몰래 걸어오는 척하는데
다 티남
그러고는 몰래 안으려고 하는데
다 티남.
🫧 그래도 주빈이에게 태권도 안하는게 어디임

ㅋㅋㄱㅌㄱㅌㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
고마웡……
🫧 ㅋㅋㅋ 나같으면 모르는척하고 안긴다

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ그러고 있긴 해
🫧 천방지축 트리플에스 생활 이거 굉장하네요,,,

…..굉장만 할까요
🫧 한 번 확 피하면... 서아 삐질까?

해봤는데
아 왜애애애애~!!!!
왜피해ㅐ
이럼
내가 다른곳으로 달려갔거든
아아아ㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏ
이러면서 쫓아옴
🫧 빈이 느리니깐 잡혔겠네

아 그래서 잡혔나
^~^
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 착한 빈이가 일부러 잡혀준 걸로 하자 ㅎㅎ

….좋은생각이야그거

🫧 Does SeoAh still rush towards Binnie these days?

Of course, instead of rushing towards me, she pretends to walk over quietly but it’s so obvious
Then she tries to hug me secretly but that's obvious too
🫧 Well, at least she doesn’t use Taekwondo on you

ㅋㅋㄱㅌㄱㅌㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Thanks I guess……
🫧ㅋㅋㅋ If I were in that situation, I’d pretend not to notice and just let her hug me

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋI'm kind of doing that 
🫧 Would SeoAh get upset if you suddenly avoided her?

I tried it once and she was like
"Ah whyyyyy~!!! Why are you avoiding me?" 
So I ran off somewhere else, she was like "Aaaaaah!" and chased after me
🫧 Since you are slow, I guess that's why you got caught

Oh, so that’s why I got caught?
^~^
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Let’s say Binnie got caught on purpose because she’s so kindㅎㅎ

....That’s a good idea
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
