😴  
Are you sleeping?  
🫧 I just lay down on my bed, perfect timing.  

Of course.  
🫧 So, are you lying down too, Bin?  

Actually, I'm sitting.  
I heard rumors that I was mentioned on today's live.  
I couldn't watch because I was washing up.  
What did they say?  
🫧 Yup, they said if you mix YuBin and JiWoo, you get Bin.  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ JooBins  
🤍🤍  
🫧 Do you think you resemble YuBin or JiWoo more?  

I’d say both, confidently.  
^~^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Apparently, there are certain points where I resemble each of them, according to the members.  
They say my pupils resemble YuBin unnie's.  
My eyeballs... they say our eyeballs look alike.  
And with JiWoo unnie, they say our vibe and personality are similar.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
That’s the Triple S look for you.  
✨✨✨✨✨✨  
🫧 It's kind of fascinating how all the Triple S members resemble each other in different ways.  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Agreed.  
🫧 Bin, you have a bit of a doll-like appearance.  

🧸🧸  
🫧 Bin, if SooMin unnie suggests eating something, even if you’ve already had five meals, just say yes and eat again.  

Huh?  
I already rejected her today, though.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Bin, you seem really strict when it comes to eating.  

...  
You might be right...  
I sort of have a plan for eating,  
and I don’t want to mess that up.  
🫧 You’re strict about eating, so why not with cooking…?  

?  
Uh, what?  
When do I get to film a cooking Signal?  
Are you watching, contents team? 🤍🤍  
Didn't YeonJi unnie say something about that?  
She asked if they were watching.  
I wonder...  
You’ll watch, right?  
ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I'm hungry, but...  
But!  
I already brushed my teeth and put on lip balm,  
so I don’t want to eat...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
That’s just my daily life.  
Speaking of food, tomorrow's menu suggestions:  
Kimchi-mari guksu  
Or  
Bibim guksu  
!!!!!  
What do you think?  
🫧 Is there anything other than noodles?  

Kimchi pork cutlet nabe.  
I was craving something a bit more stimulating.  
🫧 If I say I don’t like it... will you be hurt? I don’t mean it in a bad way; I’ll definitely eat whatever you recommend. I’m just suddenly curious.  

Actually, not at all.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It’d be stranger if we had exactly the same taste, wouldn’t it?  
ㅋㅋㅋ  
Just eat something different.  
🫧 Be honest, you’re just writing down whatever comes to mind, right?  

Bingo.  
🫧 Honestly, I’ve never tried anything you recommended... Sorry.  

What?  
I’ve recommended things a million times.  
How have you not tried even one?  
(It’s okay, though.)  
🫧 Tomorrow, I’m going to eat a burger. Can you recommend a burger for me?  

A burger. Yes, a burger. ^~^  
Forget kimchi-mari guksu, bibim guksu, or kimchi pork cutlet nabe.  
A burger it is. ^^  
🫧 If you recommend spicy pork stir-fry or army stew, I’ll eat that instead.  

Spicy pork stir-fry, too. ^^  
Huh?  
I suddenly made eye contact with SooMin unnie for three seconds,  
and we just stared at each other,  
😐  
like this.  
With even bigger eyes.  
Then,  
Uh?  
What?  
Suddenly?  
And that was the end of the conversation.  
I still don’t know what point we locked eyes at,  
but it happens sometimes.  
So it’s not that awkward.  
;;;  
When SooMin unnie goes quiet,  
the whole house gets quiet...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Seriously, though.  
🫧 Is SooMin on a break from her world tour concert these days?  

Yeah,  
She’s taking a short break right now.  
🫧 I hope you end up rooming with SooMin and YeonJi.  

What do you mean?  
What’s that supposed to mean?  
Hey.  
Ah,  
You mean to live happily together? Hehe...  
Thanks. Hehehehe.  
🫧 Why did you tease SiOn earlier?  

Teasing?  
I was just showering her with love.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
She asked if I wanted to draw a heart with her.  
I said sure,  
but I ended up drawing it alone...  
🫧 Yeah, I saw. You drew it well.  

I knew that,  
but thanks. Hehe.  
🫧 Have you ever touched YuBin's canine teeth?  

..?  
Well,  
yes,  
I’ve touched them...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
YuBin unnie was like,  
“My canine teeth are really sharp! Touch them!”  
“Just touch them once!  
Really! They’re sharp!  
Here, here,  
aren’t they sharp?!?!”  
She was like that.  
ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So I said,  
“Oh, unnie,  
mine are really sharp, too.  
Isn’t it amazing?”  
I really do  
have sharp canines.  
So I was surprised to find someone else with sharp canines, too.  
We’ll have to have a canine showdown later.  
Whose canines are the sharpest?  
Mine are sharp enough to attack the inside of my own mouth  
with all their might.  
🫧 This Triple S is weird.  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
You just realized that now?  
^~^~^~^  
Ah,  
I’m suddenly sleepy.  
What are you going to do about this?  
You’re letting me go easier than I expected. Huh?  
..ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What are you doing tomorrow?  

Well,  
let’s see.  
Going to school, practicing, working out,  
That’s the plan.  
Maybe.  
🫧 Any behind-the-scenes stories from your object shooting?  

I rushed through some cute things near the end.  
I wonder if it’ll make it into the cut.  
I’m curious too, since I don’t know yet.  
🫧 I’m looking forward to JooManSa, too.  

The people JooBin met~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
Yawn~  
Okay, I’m going to sleep now.  
Good night!
