Glasses Ju-bim.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Oh, but
Even while taking it,
I thought, “This is so funny, how do I send this?”
But only you can see it.
Wave exclusive.
.
🫧 It’s a new angle...

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 히히
🫧 The glasses really suit you!

Arigato🤍🤍🤍
🫧 It’s unfair that only the members get to see this cuteness.

LOLOLOLOL
🫧 Your eyes are really round...🙄

Roundie..
🫧 Gong Yoo-bin says you’re like a chickpea.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Little chick Yoo-bin, what did you have for dinner?

Me
🫧 Really???

? I haven’t told you yet...
Beef brisket wrap kimbap, maybe?
I actually heard of it for the first time too.
It’s just kimbap with beef brisket
and omelette.
But I ate the omelette first, so I was too full.
So I didn’t eat even half of it.
But it was tasty.
🫧 Who did you eat with?

With Tone unnie and Lin unnie.
🫧 Did Sion get the leftovers...

.. She really ate it.
LOL
I gave one to Seo-ah,
And the rest to Sion unnie.
LOLOLOL
🫧 What do you call Seo-ah?

Seo-ah~!
Actually, I just call her Seo-ah.
I call all the members by their names…
Seo-yeon unnie~~~~~~
Ji-yeon unnie~~~~~~
Seo-ah~~~~~~
That’s how I call them.
🫧 Do the members call you Ju-bin-ah more often or Bin-ah?

Hmm,
Half call me Bin-ah,
Half call me Ju-bin.
..? Something like that.
LOL
Honestly, I’m so used to it that I don’t really remember.
But what I know for sure is that Yeon-ji unnie always calls me
Bin-ah!
LOLOLOL
🫧 Ji-woo, whenever she talks about you, says “my baby Ju-bin.”

But it’s true.
Ji-woo unnie often calls me “my baby Bin.”
🥹🤍❤️
🫧 What does Kaede call you?

Bin-chan ~~~~ !!!
Today too, when we met,
Kae-chan ~~~~ !!!🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
And we both laugh.
🫧 Then what do you call me?

Wave.
? Hahaha
Hey Wave,
Did you eat?
LOLOLOL
🫧 I’ll call you Bin-ee Babo~~~

Ridiculous.
;;;;;;
🫧 Bin-ah, Babo (Fool) means kind, actually.

Ba: Bada
Bo: Boon-got, you’re kind.
Is that it?
Ah, I’m a master of three-line poems.
Give me a word.
Wave?
OK.
Wave~~~~
Saying it like this... feels a bit embarrassing.
Bro…Bro..Bro want to come!!!
Wow
Genius!
!!
Hehe.
Next?
OK.
When we meet Next, do you know what happens?
All the stress is relieved, just like that.
TripleS Next, fighting!
Ah, boring.
Who gives such boring words to start with?
It’s Wave’s fault.
Anyway, then.
LOL
LOL
LOL
LOLOLOL
🫧 Lastly, can you do “Simran” for me?

I’m feeling unsettled.....
I’ll try.
Give me the first line.
I’m feeling unsettled...
Wait a minute.
Urgent matter.
Phew.
What were we talking about again?
Oh, you don’t remember?
Ah.. no helping it.
You want me to recommend tomorrow’s menu?
Alright, I can do that~~~~~~~
🫧 You’re really just going to move on like that?

^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^
🫧 Ju-bin-ah, tell me about the 24 performance video behind the scenes.

LOLOLOL
Did you see the shorts that came out today?
The one with a 1 in 24 chance is none other than none other than none other than none other than
Ju-bim!
Hehe.
LOLOLOLOL
🫧 How was Chae-won’s wind blast?

It was a bit weak.
Only one foot flew off, you know.
ㅎㅅㅎ
LOL
Ah,
My younger sibling called.
So cute.
Asking about homework.
LOLOLOL
Junior high school homework is so cute.
ㅎ
🫧 ? But aren’t you also in junior high?

ㅎㅎ I’m actually in high school now.
LOLOL
My sibling is still in elementary school,
But at school, they’re a junior high student.
So just,
Outside of school,
They’re like that.
🫧 Ah, seeing your profile pic makes me want to pinch your cheeks. Can I do that?

?
Sorry,
But that might be a bit difficult.
^~^~^
🫧 Who among the members tries to pinch your cheeks?

Lin unnie!!!!
Not just my cheeks,
She pokes my arms,
And pinches my cheeks.
Poke poke poke.
Lin unnie’s
beloved doll.
She always says to me,
“You’re my oasis..
Come quickly~~~ !!!!”
That’s what she says.
🫧 What do you think Ha-yeon thinks of you?

Well,
Yesterday, she suddenly came to our house and said,
“Make me food!!
Give me food!!
I’m hungry!!!”
I’m so hungry!!!
Make me something that won’t make me gain weight.
Cook for me.
That’s what she said.
So I asked,
“Do you want steamed chicken?”
“Does it make you gain weight?”
“Yeah, it does.”
“Hmm… I’ll eat it.”
She was just really hungry in the end.
;;;;;;
So I gave her steamed chicken yesterday.
Su-min unnie was eating next to her,
But Su-min unnie was eating all the meat,
So Ha-yeon said,
“Hey!!!!”
“Stop eating all my meat!!!”
“Why are you only eating the meat!!!!”
“There’s no meat left for me to eat!!!”
That’s what she said.
I told them not to fight and just eat.
And that was it.
🫧 Earlier, Ha-yeon gave a really touching message...

She should give me a touching moment too, Ha-yeon unnie.
The way Wave and I react is so different;;
🫧 Ha-yeon flexed for her friends, maybe she will for you too?

^~^ I’ll look forward to it.
LOLOL
VM
🫧 How is the tent? Do you like it?

Ah,
It hasn’t arrived yet.
It’s coming tomorrow.
I’ll give you a review in about 3 days.
🫧 You guys use good stuff, it’s like a secret tip.

LOLOL
Group purchase relay.
The tent and
blackout curtains
were shared in the group chat.
LOLOL
🫧 I bet there’s someone in the group chat who never talks.

Hmm,
Wow,
Everyone talks..
LOL
But it’s not like every day.
It’s just Su-min unnie and Yeon-ji unnie who talk every day.
LOLOL
They were even talking 10 minutes ago.
🫧 I love your ### part so much that I keep singing it while working part-time. 🤣

Kirei! Ko! To! Wa!
Don’t need it~~~~
It means “I don’t need pretty things.”
LOLOLOLOL
Ah,
I need to dry my hair.
It’s too long to let it air dry.
I’m going to dry my hair now.
Bye bye

Good night in advance.
