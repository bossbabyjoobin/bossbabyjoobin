Hi  
!!!  
Hehe  
I’m here~  
I came too late yesterday,  
so I tried to come a bit earlier today.  
I’m sleepy too, so just  
pick one.  
1  
2  
You’ve got two choices.  
🫧 3

Ah, I can't give you a gift then.  
Looks like option 1 is popular.  
OK.

Mandus’ first selfie 🥟🥟  
Hehe  
How is it?  
🫧 Isn’t it Crybabyz?

Huh? No.  
🫧 Was this yesterday?!

Yeah  
It’s a photo from yesterday!!  
🫧 Can’t you give option 2 as well?

Hmm  
I’ll think about it.  
So,  
do you want it?  
![[GU8r2HOaQAAtUKk 2.jpg|150]]  
Well, I guess I have to give it now.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I decorated it myself.  
Actually, if you didn't want it,  
I might've been a little sad...  
ㅋㅋㅌㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It's an MG shot.  
My arm is 3 meters long.  
^~^  
🫧 Your arm looks like a naked Pepero.

Oh, I had some today.  
🫧 Bina, do you use any app when you decorate pictures?

That?  
It's just the default iPhone gallery.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I went into editing and drew on it there. ㅎㅅㅎ  
Actually, I was going to come right after the live ended,  
but I was late because I was decorating that.  
^~^  
🫧 Then why did you make us choose between 1 and 2 when you could’ve just posted both?

Because it's fun.  
ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Isn’t it uncomfortable to type with 3-meter-long arms?

It is a bit uncomfortable,  
but I’m used to it,  
so it’s fine.  
`~~~~~~~~`  
🫧 Wow, your eyesight must be good.

Huh,  
this isn’t it.  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 If you use both arms as pillows, 24 people could fit.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 You could walk around on your arms.

That's the plan.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I just imagined it.

?  
Why would you imagine that..?  
🫧 Imagine? I already saw it in real life.

? No, my arms aren’t 3 meters long.  
?  
I feel like the mom from *The Incredibles*.  
`~~~~~~~~~~(^~^)~~~~~~~~~~~`  
Is it something like this?  
🫧 I’ve been using ^~^ a lot lately too.

Looks like I’ve rubbed off on you.  
ㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I go around calling my friends “JooBim!!!”

Your friends must be suddenly getting ambushed by JooBim attacks…  
🫧 ㅌ← Does this also mean laughing!? I just learned that.

Ah, not exactly.  
When ㅋ is next to ㅌ,  
it sometimes turns out like this.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋ  
Today,  
I was just busy.  
So I’m sleepy.  
But I’ll chat a bit before I go.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I’m not leaving yet.  
Today,  
I had a sandwich.  
🫧 What kind of sandwich?

Chicken tenders.  
So for tomorrow’s lunch suggestion,  
which is completely unrelated,  
jjajangmyeon.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ah, tteokbokki?  
That sounds good.  
Eat whatever you want.  
That's the best.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I don’t need to eat because I live off Bina’s love. Sorry.

I live off WAVs’ love too,  
but I still have to eat. ㅎ  
…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bina, which selfie is your favorite? Tell me just one.

Hmm  
I can’t choose.  
Maybe the wavy hair selfie?  
I like all the wavy hairstyles.  
🫧 Bina, talking about sandwiches reminded me,  
do you have a go-to Subway order?

I don’t have anything special,  
I only eat one thing.  
Steak and cheese!!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What do you usually drink when you eat? Like water or something.

Milk  
!!!!  
I had milk with today’s sandwich too.  
But drinking milk doesn’t make you taller.  
Or does it?  
I drank so much milk as a kid  
that I don’t even know.  
🫧 Are your siblings tall too?

I’m actually one of the shorter ones in my family..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Are you taller than your siblings?

Excuse me?  
What?  
..  
🫧 You could be taller, who knows…

..?  
Yeah…  
🫧 Open-minded Simranies.

.. That’s good.  
🫧 Is the fairy not coming to work today?

Yeah, the fairy is asleep too..  
💤💤💤  
🫧 They gave up on their duties in the middle of work.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I’m half asleep while chatting too. Zzzz

How about we sleep together?  
Cool down  
right here.  
Bye bye  
Ah  
Is that a no?  
ㅇㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
No, I was just askingㅎㅎㅎ  
![[240814_(11.08PM)_1.m4a]] ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ll go to sleep now.  
..ㅎ  
See you tomorrow.
