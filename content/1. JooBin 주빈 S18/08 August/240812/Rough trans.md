As for me, I still have some time leftㅎㅎ
SeoAh + Hanlimz
They're all saying they're jealous of me
..Yoohoo
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 In Japan, the new school term starts on September 1st after summer break, but in Korea, it starts tomorrow⁉️⁉️

It depends on the school but for me I still have some time left!!
🫧 Did you have the latest vacation?

I had the earliest
Hehe
How about a three-month break? 
Oh right
When I go back to school
I'll be in the same grade as the 07s unnies
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But I’ll still graduate at the same time as YeonJi unnie
YeonJi unnie always says
“Binnie, you really should’ve gone to the same school as me”
She says that a lot
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 When you go back to school, give us lots and lots of selfies~~ In your summer uniform!!!

The summer uniform is just short sleeves..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

The story behind the lunchbox prepared by JiYeon's mom for the members

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 Oh right Bin, I heard you had JiYeon’s lunchbox

Wooaaaahhhh
🥹🥹🥹🥹
JiYeon unnie’s mom packed it for the members to share
I woke up in the middle of the night
I hadn’t had a late-night snack in almost half a year but I ate that day
JiYeon unnie was like "This is the first time I’ve seen Binnie eat at night..!!!" 
It was seriously so delicious
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ Really
I even talked to her mom on the phone
Hehe
The day I mentioned eating ssambap
It was that day <sup>[t/n: Friday last week , Aug 9]</sup>
🫧 So Binnie usually doesn’t eat anything at night?

It's not that I don't eat at night 
If I do, I can’t digest it
So the result is I can’t sleep ㅜㅠㅜㅜ
I don’t eat so I can sleep..?!
🫧 Then just don’t sleep

..
Ohh
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’d rather choose sleep
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 일본 갈 때 연지가 빈이 어깨에 기대서 잤다던데

언니가 중간중간 깨길래
의식 있는 잠 깸 .. 인 줄 알았는데
그게 아니라 걍 움..zzzzz
이거였대
목받이 그건 줄 알고
기댔는데
편해서 계속 그랬대
웅 그건 사실.. 내 어깨였어…
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
근데 짖짜 웃긴 건
내 어깨에 기댄 멤버들
많아
인증샷도 있어
가끔 너무 웃겨서
찍어놨는데
적어도 6장..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 서아도 그 중 하나야

서아는 무릎
을 베더라구요…..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 혹시 그거 멤버들도 알아? 사진?

웅 깨면 보여줬어
다들 머리카락으로 가리고 자서 저거나야? 하긴 하는데

JooBin, the human pillow of tripleS

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 I heard that when you went to Japan, YeonJi slept leaning on your shoulder

It’s true
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋ
She kept waking up from time to time
so I thought she was conscious of it.. 
but it turns out it was more like “Umm.. Zzzzz”
YeonJi unnie said she thought it was a neck pillow or something
So she leaned on it and since it was comfortable, she kept doing it
Yeah.. that was actually.. my shoulder...
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But what’s really funny is
there are a lot of members who’ve leaned on my shoulder
I even have proof shots
Sometimes I find it so funny
that I take a picture of it
I’ve got at least six of them..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Is SeoAh one of them?

SeoAh rests her head on her knees…..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Do the members know about that? The pictures?

Yup, I showed it to them as soon as they woke up
They all cover their faces with their hair when they sleep, so they were like "Is that really me (in the picture)?"
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
