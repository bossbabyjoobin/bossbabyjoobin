### Translation

**🫧** Hi  
I'm back  
What's up  
Did you have a good time in Japan?

**웅ㅇ!!**  
How was your first time in Japan?

I couldn't visit many places, but I'm satisfied just with the trip to the convenience store.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I bought jelly, jelly, ice cream, ice cream, small snacks, etc.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I bought two of each~~~~ ^~*  
Oh, and tiramisu!  
I was wandering around not knowing what to buy, and Yeonji unnie, who was busy at the time, picked up something for me and said,  
"Binna!! This is really good, put this in your cart!"  
So I got it, and it was seriously amazing.  
I was like 😧😧😧  
after eating it.  
**🫧** Wait, how much did you eat in just one day?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I brought it all back.  
I only ate the tiramisu and ice cream.  
Heh, that's right.  
This is my first selfie in Japan.  
✨✨✨✨✨✨  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ouch,  
Ouchkkkk  
I banged my knee while opening the door.  
Sigh.  
It's fine.  
You're wondering how I could hit my knee instead of my foot, right?  
Well, there's a way...  
Not that I wanted to find out...  
**🫧** Is the door okay..? 🥹

..? I think the door is harder than my knee...  
**🫧** Sorry, door.

..  
A fan apologizing on behalf of the idol—how cool is that?  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
**🫧** Binna, I'm a bit disappointed. I thought you'd be able to break it.

? How would I even break a door with my knee?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Unbelievable.  
**🫧** So how did you hit it?

Well, I was carrying laundry with both hands, and as I was trying to push the door open, I ended up banging my knee...  
**🫧** So it wasn't because of FROM. We don't have to feel bad; you're just a dummy. Yo.

..? No, the first part is correct, but the second part isn't.  
**🫧** People who are different on the outside and inside are attractive.

..!  
Here comes the attractive person who banged their knee while opening a door.  
**🫧** A charming fool—sounds good.

..Yay!!!  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
When I bump into things, I just get tougher...  
Never die.  
**🫧** I'm hungry, please make me food.

I'm full though.  
**🫧** What did you eat?

I had ssambap.  
**🫧** You dared to trust Binna's cooking skills?

Don't worry, I didn't cook it myself. ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
**🫧** You missed Korean food after being in Japan for so long?

..It was just one day, but I did miss it.  
**🫧** You said you were confident.

I am confident in feeding others, you know?  
**🫧** Can Binna cook ssambap?

Of course, it's so easy.  
You just put rice on lettuce, add meat, and you're done!  
**🫧** You haven't filmed Signal yet, right? Can it be canceled?

No, I haven't filmed it, but why would I cancel it?  
Just dip it in ssamjang and eat it.  
Okay, that settles it.  
ㅎ  
**🫧** Binna, let's prove it to everyone with your Signal.

🥕  
**🫧** PLS SAY HI TO YOUR FRENCH FANS 🫶🏻😔

`Bonjour ~~~`  
`I am the best chief Joobin ~~~~ `
**🫧** Wait? Chief?

Yes, chefㅎ  
**🫧** You can't lie about not knowing something...

No, that's not it.  
**🫧** Instead of Chief, you should just say chicken so there's no misunderstanding.

?  
Best chicken story?  
What worst?  
So unfair.  
**🫧** Isn't it thief, not Chief? The one who stole my heart... sorry.

Taking advantage of the confusion,  
I like this kind of joke a lot.  
**🫧** It's fun teasing Binna in FROM.

As long as it's fun...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
No, it wasn't me, it was WAV who sent it.  
It wasn't me!!!!  
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
**🫧** Binna, stealing my heart is a crime that deserves jail time.

That's pretty intense.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
^~^  
By the way, thanks for understanding that I wrote chef wrong.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Everyone's teamwork is great.  
ㅋㅋㅌㄱㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Auto-correct issues..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Oh, you didn't know it was wrong?  
..ㅇㅋ  
I'll let it slide.  
ㅋㅌㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
**🫧** But Binna, I thought you'd say you're the best leader.

ㅋㅋㄱㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🧚🏻‍♀️✨✨✨✨ Forced memory deletion.  
**🫧** Binna, this is sudden, but have a great day today.

There's less than 30 minutes left, but I'll try.  
**🫧** Gotta go to work tomorrow too....

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Same for me..  
**🫧** I don't have work tomorrow!! I'm jealous.

??!!!!?!  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
**🫧** How's your Japanese class with Kotone going?

I don't know what I'm saying, but I just repeat it.  
When the Japanese unnies are chatting, they say something, and I'm like, "Oh," and repeat it exactly.  
Then I ask what it means, but Tonne unnie keeps teaching me stuff, and it feels a bit weird, but I just repeat it anyway.  
The other unnies are like, "Why are you teaching her that?"  
I’m like, “? What does it mean?”  
And Rin unnie tells her to stop teaching me old memes.  
That’s when I realized why the unnies laughed every time they made me say something.  
Ah—!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
They were just teaching me outdated memes one by one. ㅎㅎㅎ  
I guess I'm the perfect target to tease.  
^~^~^~^  
**🫧** Binna's puzzled face is pretty fun to watch.

It's satisfying, I admit it.  
**🫧** That expression is often seen in JooManSa!!

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
So that’s what it is.  
Right, I need to write my observation notes.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I really should write them all down.  
**🫧** JooManSa is so fun; let's upload two episodes a day.

We'll probably end up with short shorts due to lack of observation time.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
**🫧** Binna, I'm a 70-year-old grandpa, and these days, watching JooManSa is what keeps me going.

A show for everyone to enjoy—  
I like it.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
**🫧** Is JooManSa's guest list entirely up to you?

Yes, except for unavoidable schedules, everything is Binna's pick.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
The next guest might be  
[Y/N]  
Be careful.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Come on, that confidence—  
It's the best.  
**🫧** Did you get to use any Japanese while you were there?

Konnichiwa! Konbanwa~~ Onegaishimasu-! Arigato! Sumimasen~ Oyasumi  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I probably used more than half of these at the airport.  
I didn't get to introduce myself, which is a shame.  
Haaiit-! Konnichiwa! Watashiwa Joobin desu! Onegaishimasu~~~~  
I'm satisfied.  
Oh, when I was in Japan, I went to a restaurant, and before going in, I thought to myself,  
I have to say Konnichiwa!  
So I walked in, they showed me to my seat, and the staff was like  
"Irasshaimase ~~~~ ," you know?  
Without thinking, I ended up saying,  
"Konni.. Irasshaimas... Konnichiwa!!"  
How did they even react to that..  
**🫧** ??: What? Was I a customer?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hi.. Welcome... Hello!!  
Yup........  
Something like that..........  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 You even showed off your biggest charm—your silliness—in Japan too, huh?

It’s a charm I didn’t even know I had.
ㅎㅎ
Oh, so everyone knew but me?
ㅇㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 If I ever see a non-silly version of you, I might feel a bit empty.

…I’ll work hard to keep up the silliness.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Fighting for the weekend, [Y/N]!
I found some cute emojis.
Check this out: ⸜(♡'ᗜ'♡)⸝
🥹
And another one:
.｡o♡( ⸝⸝･໐･⸝⸝ )
ㅜㅜㅜ
They’re so cute that I had to share them.
ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 No matter what anyone says, 🧚‍♀️ <-- this one is the real deal.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️
I shared it with my mom too.
She was like, “Wow!”
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I sent it to my dad too, but no response.
It’s fine……
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 So I just woke my mom up to ask her about it.

.!!!!!!!!!!
Oh no, I’m sorry, ma’am..
What are you doing, WAV?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

I’m sleepy, let’s sleep.
Oh, you’re not sleepy?
Oops,
Miss!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

I’m going to sleep first.
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ
Hmph.

🫧 Give me a kiss.

? Aren’t you being too bold?
I’m flustered.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
