**Juju💚:**  
Hi!  
Did you manage well without me?  
??  
Heh  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I was so tired after Ulsan yesterday  
I knocked out  
Sorryㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 It’s okay. I was tired too, so I went to bed at 5 a.m.

**?** Are you sure you’re tired??  
Our room’s AC is fine now.  
It got temporarily broken…? I think it was just hot for a bit,  
but now everything’s working well.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Right now,  
I just got a gift.  
Hehe  
Oh my gosh,  
it’s so cute, awwwwww  
It’s a hamster holding a sunflower seed  
figurine.  
🐹🐹🐹  
🥹 It’s holding the sunflower seed with this face.  
Seoyeon unnie said she bought me something  
when she was in Japan last time,  
but I just knew about it,  
and then suddenly she goes,  
“Binna, here, catch this,”  
and threw something that looked like a tangerine.  
She said she bought it because it reminded her of me.  
It’s so cuteㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
I told her,  
“I’ll carry it around like it’s my mini-me,”  
🐹🐹🐹  
and I meant it.  
I should show it to WAVs when I meet them.  
Hehe  
🫧 *Picked it up on the way* unnie’s gift..

**A tsundere unnie’s gift..** 🎁  
Oh right,  
I went on a date with Tone unnie last time,  
and we got matching keyrings.  
I usually don’t buy keyrings or anything like that… I’m not against it,  
but I hesitate to spend on stuff like that.  
But there was a keyring Tone unnie really wanted,  
so I got a matching pair and gave one to her.  
I’ll take a picture and show you later.  
🫧 Where do you draw the line when it comes to using informal speech with the unnies?

Hmm,  
it’s kind of a mix of informal and polite…?  
Of course,  
I speak fully informal with some unnies + Seoa,  
but I mix polite and informal speech with others.  
🫧 But you speak informally with us...

Hey, I originally used polite speech,  
but you guys told me to use informal!  
Okay, I’ll use polite speech from now on.  
Got it.  
Yes ^~^  
I like Juju💚-nim  
^^  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅌㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It’s awkward.  
🫧 It’s nice, feels like the early stages of a relationship.

Wait, do people really use polite speech at the start of a relationship?  
That sounds more like an interview??  
"Hello,"  
"Yes, hello,"  
"Have you had lunch?"  
"Oh yes, I have, did you?"  
.....  
That’s just an interview.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 That’s the way you talk to elders, right?

Oh…  
No, that’s just polite speech.  
Hello~  
Have you eaten?  
Yes, you too?  
^~^  
A gentler version of polite speech.  
Honestly, it doesn’t matter.  
I’ll just speak informally.  
^~^~^~^~^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Hey,  
Have you eaten?  
How about you, sir?

That’s way too cold.  
Rejected.  
How about we restore things to normal?  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Fine, love you.

**Wung, me too**  
🫧 There’s something behind you, Binna.

It’s just a pillow behind me.  
🫧 Binna, can you recommend what to eat?

Bulgogi rice bowl.  
Not because I had it,  
just because it’s delicious.  
Heh  
🫧 Binna, you always seem to post on From your bed.

Surprise.  
I’m on the sofa right now.  
^~^  
I’ve got good news  
and bad news.  
Which do you want to hear first?  
🫧 Bad news.

Alright.  
The bad news is,  
I’m going to bed early tonight...  
Now, the good news.  
The good news is  
Juju💚 is sleepy too.  
Right?  
Nailed it……  
Wow, WAVs are so in sync.  
Everyone’s just sending question marks.  
As expected, we connect.  
❤️  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Oh, right.  
Talking about Signal reminded me,  
how was my staring contest?  
Honestly,  
I think I did well.  
I’m proud.  
It’s the first time I got fast-forwarded  
on Signal,  
and it turned out to be a staring contest...  
My mom saw it and laughed, asking why I was filling time with a staring contest.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 But weren’t you allowed to close your eyes during eye contact?

What  
?!!!!!!  
It was supposed to be eye contact?  
I thought it was a staring contest  
so I stared at the camera for 30 seconds thinking it was that.  
Well,  
it’s okay.  
Gotta stay positive.  
I’m happy  
because I got to show off my beauty~ 😘  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 How did you positively take Hayeon’s “Jubin, be quiet”?

Not positively at all.  
I was like,  
“What on earth is this?”  
But then,  
it quickly changed to  
“Oh, of course.”  
ㅇㅇㅇㅇㅇ  
It was my mistake for reacting...  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
But Rinn unnie and Sion unnie said they love me,  
so it’s okay.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binna, tell me you love me too.

Nope.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Key  
🫧 Maybe Hayeon was just shy.

I know,  
but everyone, please just pretend you don’t notice.  
Got it?  
She’s always like that because she’s shy,  
so I’ll just have to understand her. ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I said I was going to bed,  
but now I’m a liar for not going to bed;  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Alright, I’ll really sleep now.  
You did well today too.  
Let’s power through Monday,  
and have a great week thinking about me. ㅎㅎ  
Love you.
