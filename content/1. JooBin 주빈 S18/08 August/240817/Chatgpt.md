**VM1**
 It means "hi."
Heh
You're still up, what are you doing?
Go to sleep!!
🫧 You'll be late.

Caught me
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I'm in the stage before drying my hair.
Half lying on the couch.
It's too long,
so lazy.
Ugh.
🫧 What rank were you in showering today?

3rd!!
🫧 How long does it take to dry long hair?

For me, it's like,
skincare while air drying
-> sitting on the couch, blow-drying / phone, repeat endlessly.
Something like that? Hehe
At least 30 minutes? Heh
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But if I dry it properly,
it dries in under 10 minutes.
No,
earlier today,
I was doing a face mask.
Since SooMin unnie was the last one to shower today,
I was going to tell her to put on a mask before showering,
but the mask was a CheeKaWa face mask...
Anyone who saw it would burst out laughing if they made eye contact,
so I just said, "Unnie, go ahead and shower `~~`"
Then went into my room.
SooMin unnie came in to shower,
we made eye contact,
and I burst out laughing awkwardly.
Even my pajamas are CheeKaWa ^~^
It's a set.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
There's never a time I don't laugh when I'm doing a face mask.
Funny things just
happen
when I'm masking.
;;;
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Take a selfie with the mask on later.

Actually, I took a selfie with the mask
because it was a gift.
I was planning to send it to the friend who gave it to me...
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 WAVE = friend

WAVE = wave ^~^~^~^~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Oh, I should dry my hair now.
`~~~~~~~`
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
By the way,
how was my dinner recommendation?
Mapo tofu
over rice.
It just came to mind.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
What should I eat tomorrow hehe?
Today, I
ate...
oatmeal porridge
and salad.
🫧 Ew.

..?
🫧 What does oatmeal porridge taste like?

It's good.
I had tuna oatmeal porridge
with seaweed.
🫧 Do they sell it at Bonjuk?

I made it myself, hehe.
🫧 Wow~ With tuna and seaweed`~~~~`? That's so cool! Awesome!!! Amazing!!! 👍👍👍

Yeah.
Can I get a normal reaction, please?
^^
It turned out well,
I promise!!!!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It's more like cooking,
since I just eyeballed the oatmeal, water, egg, and tuna.
But I'll call it cooking.
Instincts are important.
🫧 People who can't cook usually say they go by instinct.

A true master doesn't blame their tools.
A master goes with their instincts.
Trust me~~~~~~~~
Oh, right.
Today at the WAVE
fansign,
everyone was good at speaking informally.
They all started talking casually from today.
The funny thing was,
everyone was a bit shy, haha.
But honestly, I was already speaking casually.
People said everyone seemed so polite.
Thanks, hehe.
I didn’t expect anyone to actually say, "You all seem even more polite in person."
Thanks...
Phew.
Tomorrow's breakfast plan:
fruit-filled yogurt,
French toast,
milk.
Perfect!!
How could you not know what French toast is?
I'm disappointed.
🫧 What’s French toast?

French toast is...!!
No one knows.
.........
Wait,
I didn't make it up.
It exists.
Look it up on Naver.
Search it.
Is it not there? Hehe
It's real.
Start using it.
Hey, let's have some French toast!!
What is that?
You don’t know this? It’s French toast.
Short for everything...;;;;
Predicting the future.
🫧 Seeing you and YeonJi bickering on Signal today was cute.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But the sound was too loud,
I couldn’t hear.
Even other members couldn’t hear.
That was not my ears' problem.
It was just the sound.
An issue.
Hehe.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It was a volume issue, wasn’t it? Hehe
🫧 No… I just dropped my phone, and the back is shattered…ugh.

Oh no.
..
Well, since it's already broken,
why not get a new phone?
Let’s refresh your mood.
🫧 I dropped mine earlier too, and it got chipped ㅠㅠ

Why is everyone dropping their phones?
WEdonWEsan!
WAVE buys it with WAVE money.
Hehehehehehehehe
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’ll cheer you on.
[Y/N] !!! 👏👏👏 Fighting!!! 👏👏👏
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’ll do a three-word poem.
Give me a word.
🫧 "Love you"

I think it’s time to say it now.
The times
spent with you were really precious, but now
the sun has set, and I'm sleepy. Let's sleep now, hehe.
Ah,
I’m too perfect...
What can’t I do?
Hehehehe.
Okay,
give me the next challenge.
I’ll try a four-word poem now.
🫧 "Bin is a fool"

? Okay...
Shall I sleep with Bin?
Like this 💤💤💤💤
Just like this 😴😴😴😴
Just like this 😴😴😴😴
Wow,
am I a genius
..
No fun, get out.
Wait,
I’m gaining confidence.
If I’m asked to do a three-word poem again,
I think I can do well.
🫧 Then how about a five-word poem now?

Okay, last one, a five-word poem.
Give me the phrase.
🫧 "TripleS"

In the land of TripleS, there lived 24 princesses.
They had so much fun playing 🕺💃🕺💃.
Plus!!! They played again ⛹️‍♀️🤽‍♀️🤾‍♀️.
And then, exhausted, they
fell asleep peacefully~~~~~~
Wow,
I’m a genius...
🫧 I admit it this time.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
At this level,
I deserve some recognition.
⸜(♡zᗜz♡)⸝
This one’s sleeping too.
^~^~^~^~
It’s sleeping too.
``-~-~-~-~-`

So cute.

Good night.
Enjoy your breakfast tomorrow,
have a great weekend,
and see you again!
