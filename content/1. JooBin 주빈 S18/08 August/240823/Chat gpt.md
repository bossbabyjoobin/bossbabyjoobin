WAVEs~~~ 
Hurry up, hurry, hurry!!!
!!!
Guess what I did?
I changed the message!
No one noticed, right?
ㅎ
🫧 Hello, WAVEs?

No,
It's Waveu.
Waveu feels
more intimate than Wave.
It's cuter.
🫧 What was it before?

.. Not knowing this is disappointing.
If I hadn't said anything,
you would've thought it was like that from the start,
right??
Hmph.
Before, it was
🌊🫧✨.
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Finally,
Friday.
What's Friday?
A happy day~~~~~~~~~~~
🫧 The day JooBin gives selfies.

?
Original intention?
Hehe
![[GVmDxT4WUAAGUWJ.jpg|150]]
Ta-da!
I'm still practicing.
That was around day 2 or 3 of practice?
Somewhere around there.
From now on, I'll record things like this 📝📝.
Honestly, I was late because I was debating over it.
Whew.
🫧 But honestly, why do you even worry? All your photos are pretty.

No, I’m addicted to overthinking.
What do you know?
🫧 I like you, I like you, I like you~~~

I like you~~~!!!
🫧 Do you have a special photo that you’re perfectly satisfied with?

Those are usually
candidates for profile pictures.
![[240823_1 1.m4a]]
^~^
🫧 But it's funny that Bini says "Monmalal?" instead of "Monmalal?"

"Monmalal" is too long.
You know what I mean?
"Monal?"
🫧 Did you apply for Signal cooking?

ㅇ우우우우우ㅜㅇㅇ!!!!!
I applied for 1,025 Signals.
Lunchbox,
and the rest, if I tell you, it won’t be fun.
So, I’ll just store it
in my mouth, in my stomach.
🫧 Please finish Joomansa first... 24 people, when will you get through all of them?

-Longest Project-
It will continue all year long.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ
(and beyond)
🫧 When did you film today’s Shorts?

When was it?
Recently.
Last time,
they suddenly said, "Turn around."
So I was like, "Huh?"
Then we did push-ups, seven of them.
Now they say, "Turn around..."
"Turn around..."
"Please!"
So I turned around, and "Oh!!!!"
Actually, I didn’t notice Yeonji unnie,
so I was just like, "Huh?"
Then I was like, "There!!! Signal application is up!!!"
🫧 But the workout part got cut.

Ah..
Was my posture a miss?
Hmm.
🫧 Then how did you apply for Signal before?

Oh, I just
met with the contents team,
and said,
"I want to film Signal with this person!"
Then they made it happen.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
They made notes for each request and did it..
Amazing..👍🏻🥹🤍🤍🤍🤍
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Summing up the opinions of 24 people,
it must’ve been like experiencing being a high school teacher…
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Why is it suddenly so funny to imagine 24 girls?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Self vlog on the way to school.

The problem is, it's raining these days.
On the way to school,
with an umbrella in one hand.
If it doesn’t rain,
someday,
someday very soon ^~^
But I can’t use my phone at school.
..
Vlog on the way to school..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It would just be, "I'm leaving the dorm now!"
"Arrived at school!! Bye!"
And that's it..?
ㅋㅋㅅㅋㄱㅋㅅㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Skipping the process vlog
Hmm
I'll consider it for now...
🫧 Did you just rhyme "consider" and "guryer" on purpose?

Kahahahahahahahaha!
![[240823_2.m4a]]
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 It's so funny, haha.

WAVEs,
let’s do well.
.
Put your soul into it,
that’s what I’m saying.
🫧 But really, it’s fun.

I know.
Moving on.
JooBim magic ~~~~~~~~~~~
The magic that makes memories disappear.
Moving on, okay?
Today, I ate
Greek yogurt and blueberries.
And with Jiyeon unnie,
we had some chicken gangjeong.
💃🕺💃🕺
🫧 What do you usually do with Jiyeon?

With Jiyeon unnie,
we don’t really "play" together,
but we talk a lot.
Since we’re in the same house and the same room,
we really do talk a lot.
🫧 No sword fighting with carrots or anything?

? What do you take me for?
🫧 Soomin makes you laugh, Jiyeon talks with you—a good roommate duo.

ㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Makes me laugh, you sayㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Besides roommates or NXT, who do you talk to the most?

Seoyeon unnie,
Mayu unnie,
Joo unnie,
in the last...
three days? Based on that.
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Do you talk to Seollyn in English or Korean these days?

What do you mean these days,
it’s every day.
🫧 In NXT, who do you talk to the most?

Since there are so many events with Lin unnie in NXT,
I talk to Lin unnie a lot these days.
Oh,
when I said "every day,"
I didn’t mean that, haha.
Sorry.
🫧 Does Yeonji still get on your nerves?

Every day.
King.
With Seollyn unnie,
Korean.
-Conclusion-
🫧 First time seeing Bini being so clear and decisive.

Why is it the first time?
Eh?
??
???
Wait a minute,
guess what I’m about to say.
🫧 How would I know?

![[240823_3.m4a]]
🫧 Love you?

Ah,
the answer was,
"I love you."
You’re sharp, WAVE...
Love you~~~~~~~~~~~🤍
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ Hehehe~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Is it obvious?
ㅇㅋ..
ㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I'm so disappointed in you, I need a late-night snack.

Late-night snack
since it's raining,
warm
kimchi stew..?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Do you like tofu?

Yup,
tofu is delicious.
Kimchi stew, soybean paste stew, kimchi jjim, tofu kimchi, soft tofu,
every kind of tofu
is delicious.
🫧 What even is kimchi? Foreigners don’t know 😣

Kimchi
🥬+❤️=Kimchi.
It’s a delicious
food you tear apart with your hands.
`^~*!!`
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Have you ever made kimchi yourself?

There was a time I enthusiastically offered to help.
But when my younger siblings said the same thing,
I almost said,
"Just staying still is helping."
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
![[240823_4.m4a]]
So, how is it?
Today's
recommended song,
"Hash ###."
I've been singing it all day..
La-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la-hash,
Ddu-du-du-ddu-ding,
Ding-ding-ding-dong.
La-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la-hash!
Ddu-ra-do-ri-di-ro-di-ro-oh-oh,
Ddu-ee-ee-ee-ing~~
Shak!
🫧 Wow, you're so fast at typing.

...Thank you.
🫧 Truly, the best music before bed.

ㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Heh.
I’m going to sleep now.
Bye.
👋🏻👋🏻
Sleep well,
see you tomorrow.
🤍
I kept singing "Hash" in the room,
oh, let me say this before I go,
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ.
But,
I thought Soomin unnie wasn’t there,
and Seollyn unnie was wearing earphones,
so I thought no one in the room could hear me.
So I was just singing to myself,
"la-la-la-la-la-la-la
hash,
ddu-ra-do-ri-di-ra-di-rong,
ding-ding-ding-ding."
I was making weird noises like that,
but Soomin unnie was in her bed.
ㅎ.
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ.
The funniest thing is,
she was so focused that she didn’t hear any of it,
except for a little bit of "Hash!"
She said she didn’t notice
because she wasn’t paying attention, haha.
🫧 Soomin’s concert break turns into JooBin’s concert.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Whew.
Our room is fun.
Hehe.
Now I’m really
going to sleep.
Bye.
