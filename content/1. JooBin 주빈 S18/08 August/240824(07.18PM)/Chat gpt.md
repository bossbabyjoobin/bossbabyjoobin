**VM**
What are you doing?
Did you eat?
🫧 No lie, Bini said she’d come early today but arrived right after I asked.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I think I might be a little busy,  
So I came quickly.  
I’ve eaten.  
🫧 Bini, are you all prepared to go to Japan?

Once I wash up, I’ll be done.  
Lately, I’ve been into salads.  
I also ate meat and rice,  
So don’t worry,  
I’m taking care of myself well, hehe.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Recommend me a meal~

Kimchi stew,  
Meat,  
Rice,  
Steamed eggs.  
How does that sound?  
Eat it all!  
^~*  
🫧 There are many types of meat, so you should pick one.

Steak,  
Pork belly.  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
With kimchi stew and steamed eggs,  
Pork belly seems right.  
Honestly, I prefer  
meat without any fat  
more than pork belly, haha.  
🫧 Thin meat vs. thick meat?

Small pieces,  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Small pieces  
are easier to eat.  
Big ones  
take forever to chew.  
Just go with the small pieces.  
🫧 When we get to Japan, we should definitely go to a convenience store!!!

Right,  
Recommend me something!  
!!!  
🫧 Wouldn't it be better to ask the Japanese members?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Japanese WAV,  
Tell us!  
🫧 When the Japanese WAV tells us, share it with us too.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I was planning to keep it to myself, hehe.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 At FamilyMart, try the yogurt frappuccino and Famichiki.

Oh, right.  
🫧 I still highly recommend the Seven-Eleven smoothie. Also, the pudding.

That smoothie made from fruits at Seven-Eleven?  
I saw it in a video.  
I’ll have to buy a lot of bread.  
🫧 Bini, have you packed everything to take to Japan?

Yes!  
I finished quickly,  
since I already had a checklist.  
I just had to pack everything.  
Hehe.  
🫧 I came back to Korea from Japan yesterday… I ate 6 melonpan a day….

Oh,  
What does melonpan taste like?  
Is it melon-flavored?  
...Yes.  
Melon flavor  
feels artificial,  
so I’m not a fan.  
Does it have that artificial taste?  
🫧 Bini, bread itself is artificial, hehe.

What are you talking about!!!  
How savory, tasty, warm, and sweet it is.  
It’s environmentally friendly.  
It has a very warm taste.  
You’re saying nonsense, seriously.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Then what’s your favorite bread, Bini? Hehe.

I don’t think  
I can ever choose…  
🫧 Birthday bread.

?  
🫧 My favorite bread is "Joobin bread" hehe.

?  
Sorry, WAV, I’m out.  
🫧 Bring Sion and pick one right away.

If you talk about bread with Sion unnie,  
It’s no joke,  
You can talk for over three hours.  
You have to be careful...  
Last time,  
It was me, Seoa, and Sion unnie,  
And Seoa ordered some chocolate cake.  
We were talking about it,  
And since Sion unnie was in the same room, she knew what Seoa ordered,  
So she said, “No, that’s not cake, it’s pudding.”  
But Seoa insisted it was cake.  
Sion unnie argued, “That can’t be cake.  
It’s pudding.”  
So Seoa responded, “But the store labeled it as cake.”  
Sion unnie said, “But it’s pudding.  
It’s bread pudding!!! It’s not cake.  
You can’t call it cake.”  
Seoa said, “But the store wrote it as cake…”  
Listening to this,  
I wanted to go to that store and ask,  
“Excuse me, can you please confirm it’s pudding?”  
*sigh*...  
🫧 Which side are you on, Bini?

...I haven’t seen it, so I don’t know,  
But whether it’s cake or pudding, it’s bread, right? Just eat it…  
🫧 Sion’s bread pride vs. Bini’s cooking pride, which is stronger?

I’ll admit defeat.  
I want to lose...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Yeah…  
I can never win.  
🫧 Bini, hurry up!  
I’ve already arrived in Japan quickly and am waiting.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ll come quickly. 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️  
🫧 Bini, is there anything you really want to do when you get to Japan?

I’ll pack Don Quijote into my suitcase.  
🫧 Bini, the moon is beautiful...

Is the moon beautiful right now?  
🫧 Has your roommate already been decided, Bini?

Oh right,  
I don’t know yet.  
Who could it be?  
I’ll guess.  
From the feeling,  
Hmm…  
I’m the third from the back.  
The third member from the front is  
Soomin unnie..?  
Or maybe  
Rin unnie?  
Or  
Jiyeon unnie?  
I’ll guess it’s one of those three.  
If I’m right,  
I’m a genius, hehe.  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I’ll let you know tomorrow.  
Seollin unnie was drinking cocoa.  
The smell of cocoa reached all the way here.  
Mmm~~~  
Smells nice.  
She came here like that.  
🫧 Do you like hot chocolate? Or iced chocolate?

That’s a question with an obvious answer.  
It depends on the season.  
In summer, iced.  
In winter, hot.  
No exceptions.  
Look,  
Listen.  
Standing outside in this weather,  
Holding hot chocolate and drinking it?  
You might evaporate with the hot chocolate.  
It’s dangerous…  
Be careful!!!  
**VM**  
And,  
When you’re freezing,  
Shivering like crazy  
In that weather!!!! If you drink iced chocolate???  
You’ll turn into a snowman holding a frozen chocolate.  
🫧 That’s the fun of it.

..  
Do what you want.  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bini, have you been studying Japanese hard?  
Can you pay on your own?

…..? Isn’t Japanese and math a different field..?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Maybe they meant if you could handle a conversation at Don Quijote on your own?

Oh, including the conversation,  
Hehe.  
Actually,  
I have a secret weapon.  
Ttone unnie and Rin unnie!!!!!!!  
Hehe.  
Just saying “no”  
should be enough……  
^~^~^~^~^  
Actually,  
Last time,  
During the full group schedule in Japan, I went to a convenience store.  
I managed to pay and even get a bag, somehow.  
Then suddenly, they said something…  
Oh oh oh oh ooooh.  
🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫  
I was like this.  
Ttone unnie!!!!!!!!!!  
Help me.  
And succeeded, hehe.  
They were just asking if one spoon was enough.. hehe.  
If they’d said, “Need a spoon?” I might’ve understood...  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 How about "Is one spoon enough?" How’s my Japanese, hehe?

Below me, yes.  
ㅋ  
Below me.  
Ah, so  
I downloaded an app.  
There’s a special app that translates Japanese products into Korean.  
I downloaded it in advance.  
This time, I’ve resolved to try on my own.  
But honestly, I feel like that determination will disappear as soon as I arrive.  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Anyway,  
The members are packing their bags right now.  
Soomin unnie asked me,  
“Bini, what do we need?”  
So I told her~~~~~~  
Pajamas, wallet, charger, toiletries,  
I listed everything for her.  
After I read the whole checklist,  
Soomin unnie just said,  
“Okay.”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
And went back in.  
🫧 Soomin just makes a checklist of what she wants to buy.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Actually,  
When I heard that Soomin unnie shared it,  
I was like, “Oh, I have one too.”  
I wrote down about 30 things.  
But I divided them into categories like “convenience store, Don Quijote, cosmetics.”  
🫧 If you wrote down

 your favorite things as a list, the post might become too long.

I’ll do it, hehehe.  
Anyway,  
I need to sleep.  
There’s a lot to do tomorrow.  
Thanks, WAV!
