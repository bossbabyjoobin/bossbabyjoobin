A wholesome Lynn story

#JooBin #주빈



🫧 Bin, tell me what you ate today so I can eat the same thing tomorrow

Ssambap!  <sup>[Rice wraps]</sup>
Plus the convenience store chocolate that Lynn unnie bought for me in Japan
Unnie remembered that I said once that it was delicious
So she kept buying it for me over and over again  
🥹🫶🏻🫶🏻  
 🫧 Lynn seems cold but she’s actually a warm-hearted unnie

I agree  
Her first impression was like a cold model unnie  
but that’s not true at all
She’s like a cat unnie
always looking out for me 
and she loves me so much…  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ

#JooBin #주빈

I’m listening to a song right now  
🫧 What song?

Virtual Angel🪽🤍 by ARTMS sunbaenim 
I’ve listened to it more than ten times today...🤍  
🫧 But it’s only been 26 minutes today?

…You're precise 
Yesterday + today 
^~^

YeonJi catching strays

🫧 Binnie! My Korean teacher!!! I'm studying Korean... Can you explain the difference in pronunciation between 코피<sup>[nosebleed]</sup> and 커피<sup>[Coffee]</sup>?ㅠㅠㅠㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Alright
The 코 in 코피 is like when you say "Kooootone unnie!" <sup>[KR: **코**오오!!!!! 토네 언니]</sup>
Then the 커 in 커피 is like  "Xinyu unnie is  tallllll!!!!"  <sup>[KR: 신위언니 키가 **커**어어!!!!!]</sup>
Got it? 

`[t/n: This won’t make much sense by just reading it unless you know how to pronounce the word correctly 😭🤣 I wish JooBin had explained it in VMs instead]`

 
 
🫧 It feels like you’re teaching kindergarten students

That was my dream job
^~^~^  
🫧 A kindergartener?

?  
No, a teacher…………..  
🫧 Is that why you’re good at playing with Yeonji?<sup>[EN]</sup>

ㅜㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋlolllll
