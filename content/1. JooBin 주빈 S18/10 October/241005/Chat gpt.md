Mohaeng
Good job!  
🫧 How's it going, Mohaeng?  

I'm lying down at about 145 degrees.  
Hehe.  
Hahahahahaha.  
Right?  
I'm sitting but also lying down, in that kind of position.  
Heh.  
Did you eat?  
I guess it must be time to eat.  
Hehehe.  
Oh, you ate well.  
🫧 What did Binnie eat?  

A lot!  
I even had Tteokbokki!!!!!!  
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍  
Hehe.  
🫧 I heard Si-eon’s parents brought some.  

That's right! 🫶🏻 I'm so grateful that the members bought it for us to eat 🥹.  
It’s so delicious.  
😋😋😋  
I shared Tteokbokki with Hayun unnie and sweet potato Tteokbokki.  
🫧 I couldn't go to Seongsim-dang today because I was busy getting settled... I’ll go tomorrow.  

Hahahahahaha, yeah.  
Make sure to eat Tteokbokki!  
I think Tteokbokki is the best at Seongsim-dang.  
Yummy yum.  
🫧 That cake from Seongsim-dang is really delicious, Binnie.  

Of course, hehe.  
For me, the strawberry chocolate chiffon cake was the best.  
❤️❤️❤️  
🫧 What's your favorite cake, Binnie?  

I like cheese, strawberries, chocolate, and tiramisu—all of them! Hehe.  
🫧 Do you drink coffee, Binnie?  

I don't drink coffee, but I eat tiramisu.  
😉  
🫧 What's with the cute curly hair today...?  

Oh right, today’s concept is pure, canceled.  
Cute...  
Changed.  
^~^  
Hahahahahaha.  
I'll be pure tomorrow.  
Hehehe.  
🫧 I was surprised that you looked cute when you said you'd be pure today.  

Hahahahahahaha.  
It just turned out that way, haha.  
Let's postpone it to tomorrow.  
🫧 Weren't you cold today, Binnie?ㅠㅠ  

Yeah.  
Was it cold for the Wayve?  
We had our denim jackets, so we weren’t cold at all.  
🫧 I was shaking and turned into a chicken feet.  

Oh no...  
That’s unfortunate...  
🫧 I want to eat chicken feet.  

You can't eat the Wave members!  
Quickly escape; the chicken feet Wave is coming for you.  
The hungry Wave is coming to get you.  
I wish you luck.  
ㅃㅇ  
^~^~^~^~^  
Hahahahahahahaha.  
Now at this timing, let’s do a snack suggestion.  
I want something a bit spicy because my mouth is too sweet.  
Chicken feet?  
Hahahahaha.  
Tteokbokki.  
I decided on kimchi stew.  
It’s tempting.  
Of course, I'm not eating it, but enjoy it! ^~^~^~^  
By the way, did the episode of *Immortal Songs* come out today??  
![[1728139665992.png|150]]  
Cheers!  
This is a photo that Sean took.  
Hehe.  
🫧 What is it? It feels like it’s been a while since Binnie had her photo taken by someone else.  

^~* That's true; I don't have anything to say.  
🫧 Wow, you look like a student...  

Well, I am a student...  
...  
😅  
Hahahahahahahaha.  
🫧 Is there something at the end of your gaze?  

The remaining 23 members.  
`*~*`  
🫧 Binnie, what do you think is the biggest difference between a 24-member event and an 8-member event?  

The number of people.  
Is it reduced to 1/3?  
...Am I smart?  
Thank you...?  
...Thank you.  
🫧 Binnie said that your school doesn’t have that kind of uniform, so you wanted to try it on. How do you feel wearing it more than anyone these days?  

That’s right!  
But I feel that our school uniforms are very comfortable.  
😊😊😊  
Hahahahahahahahahaha.  
🫧 Binnie, I heard you have a chat room for every event.  
So you must have about 7,000 chat rooms...?  

Yeah, maybe around 30,000...?  
I usually like to clean up chat rooms with a specific purpose once that purpose is fulfilled.  
So, I leave them all.  
But the last time I left, the same members had another event, so could you invite me back? I left...  
That happened before...  
Because of the possibility of it happening again, I can't leave...  
🫧 But isn’t it just a memory if you leave it? So I don’t leave.  

Won't the phone’s storage get full?  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
T?  
F!  
But I think it turned into T.  
Hehe.  
I can relate.  
But it’s slightly selective...  
🫧 Binnie, I ate bread because I was feeling down...  

You didn’t call me while eating bread?  
I’m disappointed....  
ㅜㅜㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
🥲🥲🥲🥲  
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.  
🫧 Uh... Okay... Sorry...  

Yeah… I hope you definitely call me next time.  
🫧 I want to see Binnie writing an emotional letter too.  
Whether I cry or not.  

For things like that, I can’t help but cry.  
It’s unfair; letters are...  
🫧 I’m curious about you crying, hahahahahahahaha.  

..To the members, my first impression will probably be that I was the one crying.  
Hahahahahahaha.  
No, don’t look it up.  
Don’t.  
Don’t go.  
Where are you going?  
Come here.  
^~^~^  
Hahahaha.  
🫧 You also cried when we first met.  

Huh?  
Oh right...  
I was just a crybaby.  
Hahahahahaha.  
🫧 One word about being chosen as a crybaby.  

First of all, I’m very honored to receive the crybaby title in tripleS.  
Thank you.  
I will work harder?  
Fighting!  
🫧 But you haven’t cried lately.  

That means I’m that happy. 😚😚😚😚  
Hahahahahaha.  
🫧 Binnie, can you suggest dinner for me tomorrow?  

Right now, my mouth is too sweet, and I can't think of anything but spicy food.  
How about some ssam-bap after a long time?  
Oh, really?  
I'm going to sleep.  
Hahahahaha.  
🫧 Binnie, have you grown taller?  

I don’t know.  
Nien unnie said I grew taller.  
But I don’t feel like I did.  
Hahahahahahaha.  
I’m going to bed.  
Good night.  
Tomorrow is guaranteed.  
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
Bye-bye.  
🤍
