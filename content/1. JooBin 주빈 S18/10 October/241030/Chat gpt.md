**VM1 (Hello)**
I'm not sleeping.
Actually, I came by before bed.
Hehe.
🫧 What’s this? You changed your profile picture and background?!?!

`><`
How is it?
What do you think?
🫧 So cute.

Thank you~~~ ♡
🫧 Is that the famous Park Saem hairstyle?

It’s a bit of a modified version, you could say.
🫧 It's kinda... chic.

Hai!
🫧 Was it for that W Magazine shoot?

Yep.
While organizing photos,
I found it.
Today,
I did my first bun!
Did you see?!?!
I always thought, "One day, I’ll do a bun."
And today, I asked Seoyeon unnie,
"Unnie, what hairstyle should I try today?"
She said, "A bun! You've never done it!"
So I took her advice and tried it!
Right after doing it, I showed it to Seoyeon unnie,
and she said it looked cute..
Hehehehe.
So now, there's a chance I’ll try it again.

🫧 The answer: Who pooped on my head?

Oh, correct answer.
ㅋㅋㅋㄷㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Let's try a cuter, dumpling hairstyle next time!

I’ll think about it…..
🫧 So, did you get a reply to the message you sent Kotone yesterday?

Yeah.
I sent her a photo of my hand heart
using a timer.
She sent a hand heart back.
We exchanged hand hearts.
🫶🏻<->🫰🏻
Like this.
🫧 Binnie, there’s a live this week too, so I’m glad we’ll see each other a lot this week 🤍🤍

What should I talk about with Chaeyeon unnie?
🫧 Live JooManSa

ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
So funny.
But I’m not a fun person.
🫧 Wait, you said you were fun though.

It’s more like... my thoughts fluctuate a lot,
not so much my mood.
Haha.
But why aren’t you sleeping?
Go to sleep already!!!!
My recommendations keep showing French toast,
so I think this means WAVs should eat French toast.
Haha.
🫧 If you eat French toast today, I’ll be proud.

Omg, I’m touched.
Today, Shinwi unnie tried this healthy smoothie she found tasty,
so I gave it a try right after.
As soon as I tasted it, I made this face 😧.
I turned to Dahyun unnie and asked,
"Unnie, do you want to try this? It's like… a flavor I've never experienced."
Her reaction was 😯😶😓🤔
Said it was a strange flavor.
So I went to Seoyeon unnie and asked,
"Unnie, do you want to try this?"
She gave me a similar look 😖😖.
Then, I went to Hayun unnie,
"Unnie, try this," and put it in her mouth.
Her response: "Ugh."
The overall review:
Tastes like accidentally blending strawberries with water and smoothie ingredients.
I told Hayun unnie,
"Shinwi unnie said it tasted good, so I gave it a go…ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ."
She said I shouldn’t trust Shinwi unnie's taste buds,
so I accepted it.
It was a drink with strawberries, raspberries, dates, and avocado blended together.
Haha.
I’m going to sleep now.
Let’s both get some rest.
**VM (Good night Byeeee)**
🤍🤍🤍
Fighting for tomorrow!
Sleep well.
Love you.
❤️
