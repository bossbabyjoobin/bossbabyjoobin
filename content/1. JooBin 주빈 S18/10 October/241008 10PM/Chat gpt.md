What’s up?
🫧 I'm watching the final episode of *Black-and-White Chef*.

Lol
I’ve already finished watching it.
Haha
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋ
`*~^~^~^~^~^^~^~`
Ah, it’s so fun~~~~~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I won’t spoil anything.
Hehe
I got too curious.
Seriously, as soon as I woke up today, I watched the whole thing at 1.25x speed.
🫧 You even watch *Signal* at 2x speed.

Yeah, there's definitely an advantage to faster speeds—time-saving.
ㅎㅅㅎ
🫧 But can you still hear everything?

Yeah, but it depends on the video. If I want to focus, I don’t speed it up. If I just want to get through it quickly, I speed it up. And every time, people around me are like, “Binnie, can you even hear anything doing it that way…?”
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’m like, yeah, I hear just fine…?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 If you speed up the parts with YeonJi or SooMin in *Signal*, you probably can’t understand anything, huh? Haha

...Skip.
Oh right, I had a dream last night where SooMin unnie and YeonJi unnie showed up. The members and I went to an event in Busan. We had some free time, so the three of us decided to take a quick look around the city. While walking, we found a snack place, so we went in. The three of us had tteokbokki, fish cake, and sundae. Then, YeonJi unnie asked me, “Binnie, do you wanna share some takoyaki?” so we ordered that too. We also got mul-tteok (water rice cake), but before it came out, we had to leave.
ㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ
🥺🥺🥺🥺
Then I woke up right after…
🫧 If they even show up in your dreams, that’s love.

Maybe it’s love for mul-tteok.
🫧 That’s the worst ;  ;

..Agreeㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ
🫧 I ate the leftover mul-tteok for you~

Oh, good thing it didn’t get thrown away…
🫧 Have you tried mul-tteok before?

Not yetㅜㅜ I told this dream to SooMin unnie today, and she was like, “You must really want mul-tteok.”
ㅋㅌㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 But mul-tteok is seriously delicious.

It does look tasty. YeonJi unnie went to Busan during her last vacation and sent me a mukbang of her eating mul-tteok. She was like, “Mul-tteok stretches like cheese!!!” Watching it made me want to try it. I should go to Busan with DaHyun unnie next time. I haven’t asked her yet, but I’ll just follow her and be like, “Unnie, I came with you, so let’s eat mul-tteok!”
Haha
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Why are you here so early today?

Just felt like coming early.
🫧 Binnie, since you’ve been going to a lot of university festivals lately, what do you think when you go?

It’s fun, kinda feels like a national tour experience.
ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 When are you coming to Jeju, Binnie?

?
Call me and I’ll fly right over.
✈️🍊
🫧 Have you been to Jeju before?

A lot! I’ve tried horseback riding, zip-lining, surfing—done pretty much everything.
^~*
But what stays with me is *ma-eumsand*.
Haha
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I bought *ma-eumsand* for my mom, and she loved it.

Looks like your mom and I have similar taste.
Hehe
🫧 Binnie takes on bungee jumping!

I actually want to try it, but I’m holding back from saying it out loud because I’m scared I’ll actually end up doing it.
Shh
🫧 Do you like scary things?

Only when it comes to rides. As for ghosts and zombies that give off horror vibes... I really don’t welcome them… I don’t like horror movies either... Thrills and fear? I’m out.
🫧 Mayu and the haunted house vs. Nien and bungee jumping?

Ughhhh, I’ll go bungee jumping with Nien unnie.
Whew.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Binnie, what’s that under the tent?

It’s my sofa.
Haha, too bad, huh?
^~^~^~^~
🫧 Binnie, behind you...

I’m lying down here, haha.
🫧 Then in the kitchen...

…SooMin unnie is there.
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Earlier, Sion said she’s slow to catch on to trends. Do you know any trends lately?

Well, I mean, it’s true Sion unnie is slow on trends… When we first met at *Next*, a trend had already passed, but after we’d been in the house for about a month, she asked me, “Binnie, do you know about this?” And I was like, really? She then said, “Am I that slow? What’s trending these days, Binnie?”
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
She’s more into food than trends.
But there’s a lot trending these days. For example, *tripleS VV~~~~~~*.
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Right, that’s trending nowadays. Hit the floor??

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Yeah, exactly.
Today, I’m gonna go watch the latest *Signal* episode~~~
🫧 Have you decided on the next guest for *JooManSa*?

Yeah, hehe. The next guest is 87% confirmed.
🫧 Why 87%?

I’m still deciding between two people. The next guest is someone I’ve been contacting a lot lately, and the guest after that is someone I meet with often.
🫧 How am I supposed to know who it is?

ㅋㅌㅋㄱㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Since we message each other on From every day, does that mean I’m the next guest...??

...That’s pretty clever!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Well, I’ve given you a hint, so I’ll leave now. I’m going to watch *Signal* and sleep.
^~*
Goodnight.
