I’m hereee
I’m here
Ohhhhh
VM
Hehe
What do you mean
🫧 I got 44 points in English, what should I do? Give me some lessons.

……
As soon as I arrive
What are you doing?
Fighting to all students during the exam period across the country..
🫧 Does Bin’s school have exams too?

Yeah, next week.
^~^
🫧 What subjects are Bin’s school taking exams in?

By subjects... 10?!
No, subjects in total are about 10.
🫧 Promise me to get 100 points in all 10 of them.

They say not to make promises you can’t keep.
🫧 There's no running test in those 10, right?

Thankfully, no ^~^~^~^~^
I mean, I was doing laundry and when it finished, I was folding, but one sock went missing.
It must’ve gone missing again, I thought, "It must be there somewhere."
Opened my eyes wide like 👀 and looked for it, but I was the culprit.
Didn’t see one in the washer and didn’t put it in the dryer.
……..
So now I’m dragging my feet and putting the remaining sock in the dryer.
Waiting time…
Ah, it’s done?
Hahaha
🫧 You’re not telling me it took 30 minutes just to dry one sock, right?

You’re exactly right.
Spot on!
🫧 Bin, did you dry your hair in the dryer while waiting?

Dried it while waiting for laundry hehe.
🫧 The dryer must’ve been like, “Seriously? One item?”

…Still, wouldn’t it feel good to be used one more time? Maybe not.
……..hahaha
🫧 You’re spending your time inefficiently, efficiently.

Haha, the master of efficient inefficiency.
^~^
🫧 Bin, I heard you took a four-cut picture with Jiwoo while wearing twin outfits!!

Huh?
We took that photo, but the 07-line and the older sisters followed us and took the same one.
Joo-unnie said, “Bin and them are copying us! We did it first!”
She said it like that.
Where’s the photo though?
I don’t have the QR code, so I’ll find it later with Jiwoo-unnie and show you….
Sorry… 🥺😉😉😉😉
Hahahahahahaha
I’m hitting 300 days tomorrow??
Really???
No way…
It’s tomorrow?
🫧 Bin, you’ll be an adult soon.

? Woohoo
Hahahaha
🫧 Is it 300 days since I started liking you?

That’s a touching comment……….
🫧 Is it 300 days since I started teasing you?

?
Should I be thankful for this?
Thank you🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫘hahaha
Hahaha
🫧 Bin, what’s the most memorable thing during these 300 days of activities?

I’ll tell you tomorrow.
Haha
Hahahaha
Something memorable before the activities started?
I ate chicken with the NEXT older sisters in the practice room.
Heh
We were like 70% close then.
Woaaahhh, nom nom gulp.
I couldn’t eat and just went, “waaah… nom….”
At that time, I couldn’t fit a bite of chicken in my mouth, and the sisters said, “Wow, Bin’s mouth is really small..!!!!!!”
But now my mouth’s a bit bigger.
The sisters said, “Bin, your mouth has grown a lot!!!”
They praised me…..
🫧 Growing even your mouth, you’re truly a growth-type idol.

Hahaha
Oh right, today I saw the NEXT older sisters in one place after a long time.
As soon as Lynn-unnie saw me, she hugged me, and Hayun-unnie petted me, saying, “Why are you cuter today? Like a puppy.”
So I thought, “Why do the NEXT sisters like me so much? haha.”
Then Shion-unnie next to me said, “Not me.”
……..
Haha, well…
I was feeling touched, but it was shattered.
VM
I know she’s just embarrassed, I know her heart, hehe.
🫧 Why are you speaking so softly?

Just a bit shy hehe.
Sumin-unnie and Seollin-unnie are right in front of me.
🫧 Are you in the room now?

Yeah.
🫧 Is there no concert from Sumin today?

Don’t mention that. Shh, keep it a secret.
She’s already singing. She’s doing an opera.
🫧 Bin, out of curiosity, is your bed near the window or the door?

I’m by the window.
The top bunk is by the door.
JiYeon-unnie is in the inner side.
🫧 Do you still have the green bedding?

Yes, but it’s covered with my cozy tent now.
🫧 Sumin sang enthusiastically with Chaewon during the live earlier, is she by any chance?

She’s here, watching the live replay and laughing alone.
🫧 Bin, you’re not bored then.

Not bored at all.
..
Hahahaha
🫧 But honestly, we had so much fun... It was the first time hearing you laugh like that...

Hahaha
I had fun until the second song.
🫧 But you laughed so hard until the last "moo," we know you enjoyed it.

Busted…
VM
Yes
Shall we do it again?
No, please no.
No, no, never.
It’s already started.
No turning back now…
Shall I play the guitar for you?
Without waiting for my answer, unnie grabbed the guitar.
I have no idea what song it was.
VM
VM
🫧 Why is Sumin suddenly practicing guitar so hard? Are you not?

She just suddenly felt it, I guess.
She started saying a few days ago, “If I had continued playing since 3 years ago, I’d be really good now.”
🫧 I feel like she said that during your debut too...

Ah?
Haha.
🫧 Seollin must be tired too.

Hahahahaha.
🫧 Bin, take Sumin’s guitar and play it yourself.

Okay.
Let me do it.
VM
🫧 Wow, you’re so good.

I feel like you said that without even listening, but thank you anyway.
🫧 Have you learned before, Joobin?

Yeah.
I learned for about… 7 minutes?
My sibling gave up on me.
Adding what I learned from Sumin-unnie the other day, I’d say about 9 minutes?
Hahahaha
Oh my, what’s up with the teaser?
I’m shocked.
What kind of filter is that?
Suddenly wearing a cone hat.
It gave me goosebumps.
VM
How about imitating the teaser?
I’d recommend turning down the volume.
🫧 I already played it.

Oh well, nothing we can do (｡•̀ᴗ-｡)
🫧 But you know the song, don’t you...

Hahahaha
Oh, right.
It’s been 300 days!!
😚😚😚😚😚😚😚🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
🫧 Any words on this occasion?

Ahh.
First of all, I’m really touched.
Sniff
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Thank you to all the WAVEs who helped us get this far🫶🏻
❤️
Heh
🫧 This is reporter from Do It Daily Wave. What’s the most memorable moment?

It’s probably the first showcase!!
And the first fansign!!
But actually, I think the last one is more memorable than the first.
Also, crying at our first meeting with the WAVE… that’s a big memory too.
Hahahahahaha
🫧 Every moment with us is memorable and makes you happy... that’s touching...

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Really, thank you so much.
We’ll see each other even more in the future, right?
😉
🫧 We need to celebrate the 3000th day together too.

Sounds good.
Hahaha hehe.
🫧 You need to come perform at my 60th birthday, Bin.

Okay, give me your address.
Hehe
ㅎㅅㅎ
🫧 Will there be a 60th birthday object by the time of your birthday?

?
That’s interesting.
I’ll go to sleep nowwwww.
But before that, yametcha.
It popped into my head suddenly.
I don’t know why, but kimchi pancakes.
Goodnight.
Sleep well.
