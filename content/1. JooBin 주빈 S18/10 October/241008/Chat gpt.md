Ta-da, Binnie makes an entrance  
ㅎㅎ  
How is it?  
Hehe  
Got it confirmed by Seoyeon unnie  
"Unnie, how's this?"  
Got the okay and sent it  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 As expected, Seoyeon's taste is impeccable

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Come to think of it, I've been sticking with Seoyeon every day because of events lately

True  
I also keep seeing Jiwoo unnie and Dahyun unnie  
Over and over again  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I think this is the first time seeing Binnie's big four-cut photos

Correct  
I tend to prefer smaller four-cuts over bigger ones  
Though that's two big cuts  
^~^  
🫧 Maybe I like short Binnie too? ^~^

Sorry, but they're gone now  
They've been gone  
Actually, no  
They're gone  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I've gotten so used to myself  
I just thought, "Oh, is that so?"  
But then people around me are like,  
"Binna, why is your hair so long??? It's gotten longer."  
And I was like, "Huh, really?? No way."  
Then two weeks later, looking in the mirror like,  
"Oh, it really is longer…"  
People even said I've grown taller, but I didn't feel it. "Huh? That's not right, is it?"  
And then I felt it a week later  
🫧 Is it touching the floor now?

Challenge! Rapunzel  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie, challenge 175cm too

Are you just telling me to be the tallest in tripleS?  
^~*  
Not there yet  
Right now, I'm like… 5th?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Yeah, I'll climb up…!  
🫧 I'll increase my height too~

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 There's a smell of Jjapaghetti coming in from the window, should I eat it?

? Where? Next door?  
If it's outside the window, you can't eat it, can you..?  
That's just an excuse  
Don't eat it.  
Resist.  
🫧 Oh wait, I'm eating Jjapaghetti. Is it me?

Huh, you two are neighbors  
Say hi  
`~~~~~~~ `
🫧 Shout out the window asking for a bite, go go

Okay, ask for 'yametchu'?? ㅇㅋ  
Yametchu  
Jjapaghetti ^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Nope, it’s Jjajangmyeon  
With tangsuyuk  
And jjamppong soup  
This is it  
🫧 "ŧ‹"( ˙༥˙ )ŧ‹"ŧ‹" I'm going to be fat

Sorry to hear that…😉😅  
🫧 What did you eat today? I'll just eat that

I had chicken breast rice bowl  
And Greek yogurt for dinner  
Pick one and eat  
?  
Why cancel?  
Starve, what do you mean  
What are you talking about  
🫧 What did you eat last night? ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ

Oh, you're hitting right where it hurts  
ㅋ  
I got caught up in a party of fresh mandarin cake, choco pie, rice chestnut bread, and chestnut sandwich  
ㅎㅎ Couldn't resist  
You know what I mean?  
ㅇㅇ  
The good thing is  
I felt so greasy I couldn't eat much  
But it was tasty…  
Suffered the next day  
Took digestive medicine from the morning ^~^~^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Was the party fun?

It was tasty  
^~*  
🫧 Who enjoyed it the most?

Naki unnie  
Since she couldn’t eat the day before  
She enjoyed it the most the next day  
But  
I just came from watching the black-and-white chef  
It was so fun  
No spoilers  
If you spoil,  
I’ll throw my phone  
I’ll throw it  
Throwing in 3, 2, 1  
![[241009_S18_1.m4a]]  
Thrown  
🫧 I watched the black-and-white chef and now I’m hungry, is this a spoiler?

? That’s an excuse  
But WAVs, I was a bit touched  
No spoilers at all...  
Just saying weird things…  
ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
🥹😚😚😚😚  
They're really kind people…  
![[241009_S18_2.m4a]]  
I'm touched  
Oh, you haven’t watched it yet?  
You were just teasing?  
Get out  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Phew, what a relief ㅎ  
🫧 Who's your black-and-white one pick?

Baek Jongwon teacher  
🫧 Joobin, come down here

Honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to show him my cooking  
I'm afraid he’ll scold me  
Before giving it to him, I'll quickly put it in my mouth  
Nom  
Swallow  
🫧 ??: "Sigh.. come here, should you be doing it like this?"

Sorry…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Have you ever tried steamed tangerines, Binnie?ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ

???? What's steamed tangerine?  
Not oysters, but tangerines??  
You steam tangerines??  
Amazing  
Is it like roasting tangerines?  
🫧 It's as shocking as roasting pineapples

It’s tasty  
Nom  
🫧 Roasted bananas are good too

Roasted banana?  
But I think  
When you heat up fruit  
It gets sweeter  
You know?  
🫧 Binnie, if you got your license, who would you want to sit in the passenger seat?

Oh  
I’d take Yeonji unnie  
And we’d go through the drive-thru  
No need to play music  
Since there’s a human radio beside me…  
Or would that be hard for a beginner driver?  
Then I’d take Jiyeon unnie  
I’d be like,  
“Unnie, is this the right road?!?!??!!!!  
Is this the right direction?!?!?!?!!!  
Or not?!?!?!  
Learning to drive like that  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 When are you going to sleep today??

Now  
Right now  
That lyric from ‘Do It’  
Turns out to be quite useful  
Not saying I’m leaving  
But it’s useful  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
When talking about something like  
“What time are you going to do it?”  
It’s fun to say  
Right now~~  
^~^  
But seriously  
I’m going now  
ㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I need to go pick out photos  
ㅎㅎ  
See you tomorrow  
😉  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Sleep well  
Have sweet dreams  
Dream of me  
See you tomorrow  
ㅎㅎ  
Goodbye?  
Goodbye!!  
❤️
