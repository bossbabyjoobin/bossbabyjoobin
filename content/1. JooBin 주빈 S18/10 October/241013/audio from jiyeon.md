 나 지금 진짜 힘든데 옆에 피해자 주빈이가 같이 있거든
아 진짜
 괜찮아요?
누구야? 아니 안 믿으셨어
 아 어째 보면 수빈이도 피해자지
아니 제가 사건의 전말에 얘기했어요
채원이가 일단 첫 번째 날 저를 속였고요
저를 속아서 저는 처음에 안 믿었어요
거짓말하지 마 했는데 채원이가 진짜래요
그래서 거짓말하지 마 했는데 채원이가 진짜래요
진짜 누가 봐도 거짓말 같은데
야 누가 봐도 거짓말이라고?
진짜 근데 한 번 더 거짓말하지 말았다가 채원이가 진짜라니까
나 지금 등에도 닭살 돋았어
그래서 채원이가 화낼 것 같아서 일단 아 그래 얘기 들어볼게요
채원이에게 거짓말을 열심히 들어줘서
나 칼드 언니 오길래 칼드 언니한테 속였다가
칼드 언니 뭔가 안 믿을 것 같아서 그냥 빨리 거짓말이라고 얘기하고
아 뭔가 나 혼자 속기 아쉽다
그리고 난 속은 게 아니긴 해 뭔가
근데 뭔가 너무 재밌는 거야 채원이가 너무 연기를 잘해서
그래서 유빈이 언니하고 연지한테 얘기하고
진짜
4시에서 1시간 동안 얘기하다가 거짓말입니다 하고 와서
내가 여기 방에 들어오자마자 지연이 언니랑 주빈이 언니에게
채원이 진짜? 하면서 방가서 물어봐봐요
언니들이 방으로 뛰쳐갔더니 지연이 언니가 울고 있고 난리 났는데
거기서 신유 언니 니엔 언니 다 오고 난리 나고
 채원이의 거짓말
 이상 07즈의 농락에 속아난 사람들이었습니다










so we were scared and worried if the members were okay
We all(both) went to the Cookie HAUS to wait 
but we were really scared  
Then ChaeWon unnie showed up  
dressed really scarily pretending to be a ghost...?  
It turns out it was a prank all along
But honestly,  we seriously thought something dangerous was going on  
so we got so worried and went there  
but then we got scared and cried again...  <sup>(t/n: cos of ChaeWon 👻)</sup>
ChaeWon unnie wanted to dress up and do something like that  
and I wondered if they were okay
but she already said it was fine 
But honestly,  
now that I think about it, it's funny...  
but it was scary at the same time, for real......



<br>

……. Seriously  
What did they prank us with… I can’t even say it  
It was really something……….  
At first, I didn’t believe it,  
I was like, "What nonsense, say something that actually makes sense!"  
But then I started bawling  
Ha  
If my eyes are swollen tomorrow, it’s Chaewon unnie’s fault  
In the end,  
The ones who got pranked:  
YeonJi unnie, YooBin unnie, JiYeon unnie, me, Nien unnie  
And my eyes are already swollen now  
It's so hot from all the crying  
🫧 Right now, JiYeon’s Fromm post sounds like JooBin's in the same state.. I’m just a bit confused..ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

.. JiYeon unnie and I got pranked at the same time and cried at the same time  
We’re both confused……………  
The really funny thing is,  
I don’t even know what’s what anymore  
Tears just came out  
🫧 Why did you cry though.. uh.. was it a sad story?

It went beyond sad  
Thankfully, none of it was real—just a hidden camera prank..  
Whew  

No way  
Chaewon unnie  
Was like,  
“Let’s just have a chat,”  
And called everyone one by one.  
So here’s what happened:  
She called Soomin unnie first,  
Scared her,  
And it was like, “What the heck is going on?”  
Kae unnie didn’t fall for it either.  
Then the unnies called YeonJi unnie and YooBin unnie,  
Pranked them,  
And finally, JiYeon unnie and I were the last ones.  
It was like we were being called as if there was a thief,  
And we were worried about whether the other members were okay.  
So we went to the snack house together,  
Waiting while we were really scared.  
But then,  
Chaewon unnie had dressed up as a ghost..?  
It was that kind of hidden camera prank...  
But seriously, we thought something was really wrong,  
We were so worried,  
But then we got scared and cried again.  
I was like, “Can Chaewon unnie really say that while dressed up like that?”  
Turns out she already told us,  
But no, seriously,  
Looking back now it’s funny,  
But at the time, it was just scary for real...
