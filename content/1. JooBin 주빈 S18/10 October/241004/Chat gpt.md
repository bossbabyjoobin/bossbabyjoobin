I’m hereeee  
[Y/N] What are you doing?  
Yesterday,  
on the way back from Busan,  
I ended up falling into…  
a deep sleep….  
Oops hehe  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Sorry hehe  
🫧 Did you try gukbap in Busan?!!

Yup!!! I had gukbap.  
My first gukbap, yum.  
It wasn’t bad.  
But honestly,  
you have to eat the soup with meat and rice mixed together.  
And I think it’s best with kkakdugi (radish kimchi).  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Maybe next time when I try it, it’ll be different.  
That’s the hope.  
ㅋㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 How many times have you been to Busan, Binnie?

Two or three times..??  
I don’t really remember,  
but from what I recall, twice.  
🫧 Binnie, I heard you came in 2nd for Soomin’s birthday congratulations.  
What’s your secret?

I thought I’d get 1st place.  
Sigh.  
What a shame.  
![[GZDfPE6bgAAv5QX.jpg|150]]  
Ta-da  
ㅋㅋ  
I took this yesterday.  
The members also took some photos of me,  
I’ll upload those later~~~~~  
^~*  
Look forward to it.  
🫧 Bin's iconic pose 👉🏻😊

Hehe, it’s been a while.  
The members said I can’t take selfies,  
so they took them for me.  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Huh??? But you’ve really improved lately??????

I’m still practicing……  
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ah, today,  
I don’t know what I did,  
but I felt really happy 😚😉😉😉😉😉  
ㅋ  
It’s a secret.  
ㅎ  
Wait and seeㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 I’m going to Daejeon tomorrow and want to visit Seongsimdang, don’t you?

Uuuuungㅇ  
Actually, I’ve been there before.  
Their strawberry cake was the best,  
and so was their deep-fried soboru (streusel bread).  
🫧 Tomorrow, I’m going to do a Seongsimdang food challenge.

What? I want to come too. Include me.  
🫧 If Shawn takes you, they’ll pick out the best breads for you.

Even today, they came over to our house with bread in hand,  
munching away.  
Did Binnie come by now??  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 How many times a month does Sion eat bread..?

A month?  
You mean a day.  
That’s the mistake.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Right now I’m doing From while exercising,  
Soomin unnie saw me and said,  
“I thought you were taking a shower,  
but I heard all this banging and thought,  
who showers like that?”  
She opened the door,  
and was surprised that I was working out.  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I was running hard,  
and working out my arms vigorously too.  
🫧 Baby, enjoy your bread tomorrow.  
I’ll go sell bread, unnieㅠㅠ

Are you a bread shop owner, unnie?  
That’s pretty cool.  
You’re probably Sion unnie’s ideal type.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Why is Binnie so funny today?

What do you mean?  
![[241004_S18_2.m4a]]  
ㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie is always funny.

Right, right.  
You know things.  
No question marks allowed.  
^~^  
🫧 Yeah, right.

I was funny though, right?  
🫧 Don’t lie, everyone.

Our WAVs are good people❤️  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Did you see Chaewon make a strawberry cake today??  
Chaewon’s cooking Signal came out before Binnie’s cooking Signal..

I was surprised at how well she made it.  
On the day Chaewon unnie filmed that Signal,  
she bragged about it to me and Hayun unnie,  
asking,  
“Doesn’t it look good?!”  
I was genuinely surprised at how well she made it,  
but she took really bad photos.  
So I asked,  
“Unnie, why do the photos look like this instead of the cake?”  
She said,  
“That’s not the important part! Didn’t I make it well?”  
So I gave up.  
🫧 Is she worse at taking photos than you?

I’m really good at taking photos of others,  
just not myself.  
That’s why I was a photographer yesterday.  
Everyone lined up next to me.  
I took photos of Hayun unnie,  
Sion unnie, Chaewon unnie, Mayu unnie, Soomin unnie, Seolhyun unnie—  
everyone.  
🫧 Some people are just born photographers.

Maybe I should’ve become a photographer...  
🫧 Wait, did Binnie take the photos that Hayun sent me yesterday?

I don’t know what she sent,  
but after looking at the photos I took,  
Hayun unnie said,  
“Wow, I look so pretty??????? What the heck, how??”  
I said,  
“Okay, get out of here,”  
but maybe it was that one.  
^~^~^~^~^  
🫧 Tsundere Binnie.

………  
If I say no,  
she’ll chase after me.  
🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓  
And she’ll run over here.  
^^  
Honestly,  
I’ve been feeling down because I keep losing things lately.  
Like, things that should be there just disappear,  
so I felt really sad,  
but today,  
I found everything I lost.  
My earbuds,  
a single sock,  
and a pouch—  
they all disappeared at once,  
but I found them all.  
🫧 Kotone lost her clothes too.

She found them though.  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Lately, the members keep losing things  
and finding them again.  
I was worried,  
then I lost something too,  
felt sad,  
but found everything and got happy again.  
^~^~^  
🫧 It’s easy to lose and find things in a big group like yours.

ㅋㅋㅅㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Where did you find them?

They were where I normally put them,  
but I must have dropped them somewhere,  
so I kept finding and losing them again.  
🫧 Binnie, you dropped something else—WAV.

?  
I’ll pick it back up.  
✋🏻🌊  
Picked it upㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I came out to drink water.  
Ahh.  
🫧 Oh, I’m drinking water too.

What kind of connection is this?  
🫧 Are you on team cold water, Binnie?

My mom always told me cold water is bad,  
so she told me to drink filtered water,  
but I never listened...  
I was working out while waiting for my turn to shower.  
When Soomin unnie comes out,  
I’m going in.  
🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 JooBina, question question question!!!!!  
Which character do you think you resemble the most??  
Cinnamoroll, Wish Me Mell, Cogimyun, etc…?  
Pick your most Moe-fied self!!  
Please, JooBina, pick for meㅜㅜ

What? I don’t know…  
Who’s Cogimyun?  
Sounds like a Welsh Corgi.  
🫧 It’s me..

? It’s you….?  
Let me look it up.  
Nice to meet you.  
So, you dream of becoming a rice ball, huh?  
That’s kind of like me,  
since I draw good rice balls.  
^~*  
This is our first meeting,  
but it’s kinda cute.  
I’ll keep you in mind for now, you’re kinda cute.  
ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But the name doesn’t quite match.  
Cogimyun sounds more like cod roe.  
But your face is cute, sorry, friend.  
🫧 Binnie, recommend me something to eat today.

Cod roe jjim.  
^~^  
No, have ragu pasta instead.  
The reason is,  
I had pasta too.  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Ragu sauce made from scratch tastes so good.

You want me to make it?  
Wait for it~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Ah, it seems Soomin unnie finished her shower.  
Suddenly, she’s started a song medley.  
I have no idea what song it is.  
🫧 It would be funny if it turned out to be all from *Girls’ Generation*.  

When she went in, she was singing “Non-Scale.”  
♪ Falling ☆ as it touches the ground ♪  
She went in singing that.  
🫧 Binnie, you should sing *Just Do It* when you go in.  

Soomin unnie keeps changing the lyrics to *Just Do It*.  
♪ Just Do It, Yeah~!~!~! ♪  
🫧 Binnie, don’t lose to Soomin! You can do it!  

...  
*Bbyong Cherry Yum Cherry Cherry Yum*  
Yay ~~~~~~~ !!!!!  
I give up.  
🫧 Why give up after doing all that? Have confidence! I just saw the potential in you, Binnie.  

…….Ok  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Goodnight in advance, WAV  
Goodnight, everybody  
ㅎ  
Soomin unnie is out.  
🫧 Binnie, what hairstyle will you do tomorrow?!?!?!  

I’ll go with the pure look.
