Heyyy
Long time no see
ㅎㅎ
ㅋ
What are youuu doinggg?
🫧 What’ve you been up to?

Thinking of WAV? ㅎ
Today,
I had a video call
with VV unnies
ㅎㅎ
I was messaging Lin unnie and then said, "Hwaiting!!!" and sent her a selfie with Umme.
Suddenly, she called and was like,
"I miss you sooo muchㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ"
So I kept sending her hearts,
and then she’s like, "Wanna talk to someone else?"
I was like, "Sure, everyone’s good!"
So I got to say hi to Tone unnie,
JiYeon unnie,
and ShinWi unnie.
Hehe
Today, I made
a new
dish.
Hold on...
Naming it now.
Torchdu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Guess what it is.

🫧 Tomato Cheese Tofu?

How’d you guess?
...That was too quick.
🫧 Wait, I can’t imagine it.

The dishes I name usually sound confusing, but once you hear the recipe, you’re like, “Ah, okay.”
First, I mash tofu,
mix it with 2 eggs,
layer it with tomato sauce,
then load it with cheese.
Microwave for 3 minutes, and done!
🫧 So it’s kind of like eggs in purgatory?

Yeah, but without the bread for dipping.
Kind of like cheesy rice but with tofu instead.
It’s tasty.
🫧 So it’s like a pizza with tofu as the crust?

Nah, nah
It’s served in a bowl,
and you mix it all up like cheesy tofu.
Done!
🫧 I wanna make it tomorrow!

Good luck; enjoy your meal 😉
🫧 I’m starving, what do I do... I’m sooo hungry.

Then how about some Yametchu? ㅎㅎ
Wrapped rice
yum
Sounds good.
🫧 I want chicken.

Was that a rhetorical question?
^-^
🫧 When times are tough, we dance.

I…dance…when things are tough…💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺
🫧 I just head straight to bed when I’m down.

Tempting…
🛏️🛏️
Oh, and
I had a breakthrough.
I actually like mushrooms now…!!!!
I thought I’d never touch them before adulthood.
Now, I’m trying new things little by little,
like seared scallops and even mushrooms!
!!!!
ㅎㅅㅎ
Feeling grown-up.
^~^~^~
🫧 Everything you’ve mentioned, I loved as a kid, so this is a bit surprising.

Shh
🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
Actually…
I haven’t tried mushroom caps yet.
Only the stems ~~~~~^~^~^~
🫧 Lol what kind of mushroom eating is that? 😂

The stem is bigger than the cap,
so eating more than half counts as “eating mushrooms.”
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Weirdly convincing.

I’m pretty good at stuff like that.
🫧 So if mushroom sweet and sour came in school lunch, would you only eat the skin?

I didn’t even know mushroom sweet and sour existed until recently.
🫧 What do you get in your school lunch?

Braised chicken!
It’s served pretty often.
🫧 Is your principal Nien?

?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I should do a mukbang with Nien unnie sometime,
with braised chicken and broccoli.
Oh, and cucumbers too.
Stop bullying broccoli and cucumber!
🥦🥒
🫧 Can you handle bell peppers?

Yes, and paprika too.
🫧 But why not mushrooms...

So I’ve decided to accept them…ㅎㅎ
🫧 Everything else is a no-go for me.

Picky eater!!
You should eat a balanced diet.
But don’t worry,
if you don’t eat it, I will.
🫧 Is Binnie tall because she eats everything?

Considering how picky I was as a kid…..
🫧 That’s why you’re the shortest in the family.

Hmph
🫧 Wait, I just drew my eyeliner, and the cap is gone.
What’s going on??

Call for it— "Cap, where are youuu~"
If it doesn’t come out,
it’s just meant to be… Bye-bye…
🫧 Wait, I actually found it.

Yesss, it worked!
Now if anyone loses a cap,
just ask it where it is.
🫧 I’ll try it on my lost pot lid next time.

..?
How do you even lose something that big?
🫧 If I call JooBin, will she appear too?

…I’m not a lid, though.
I’m here.
I’m here~~~~~
Dun-dun-dunnnn✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
🫧 So do you and Sion plan your poses before going in?

Sion unnie and I were like,
"What pose should we do?"
After searching, we decided on
what was it…
Character Change??
I don’t even know, but we copied it.
The character with huge eyes.
Was that it?
🫧 I heard that “Moo” is popular now. We should try that.

My little sibling taught me all about “Moo” before it was cool…
They were like, “Unnie, this is Bebep.”
“Unnie, this is Moo.”
They even made it into a memory game.
🫧 My 4-year-old sibling is already memorizing the whole cast of Moo and won’t stop until I guess them all. 😅

It’s a challenge…
🫧 Then what kind of Moo are you, Binnie?

Hmm, I guess I’m “Happy~”
ㅋ
and maybe
“Sleeping~”
What do you think?
^~*
ㅎㅎ
🫧 Sweet dreams Moo~

Love Moo~
Good night Moo~
I love you Moo~
See you tomorrow Moo~
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
