JooBin aiming to be the first to greet SooMin and discussing gift ideas with WAVs

#JooBin #주빈

Today, I feel a bit like a human spinach  <sup>[t/n: She's wearing a green hoodie yesterday]</sup>
I’m wearing a couple look with SooMin unnie  
So earlier, while we were putting on clothes
I told her “Unnie, we’re matching outfits”  
And she said “Ugh, why are you copying me?"
"You're copying everything, even the shoes??”    
ㅋ It's ridiculous  
She then said "Since someone's birthday is coming up soon…"  
… I just replied "Yeah"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
🫧 Right, it’s SooMin’s birthday tomorrow. Did you prepare anything this time?

If I tell you that, it wouldn't be a secret anymore ^^
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Maybe a tent for her bed? <sup>[EN]</sup>

She already has one..  
The member who influenced me is SooMin unnie 
ㅌㄱㅌㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 How about giving her a kiss as a birthday gift

Oh please  
No way
That's not it
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 How about cookies made with Binnie's love

Oh, that’s a good one  
She’d love it  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Cookies that Binnie blew up with her love

What does that even mean?  
But SooMin unnie knows how to bake cookies too  
So I’ll pass on that  
🫧 What gift does Binnie want to get next year<SUP>[EN]</SUP>

Anything is welcomed except for a kiss.. <SUP>[EN]</SUP>
So no kisses for me either  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Binnie’s birthday gift next year: a two-hour ticket to SooMin’s solo concert

I already have that though
I'll just give myself to SooMin unnie as a gift
😊🫶🏻✌🏻🎁💝  
Who knows? It’s a secret  
Today, I’ll aim for 1st place  <sup>[t/n: In greeting SooMin HBD]</sup>
But.. can't I just greet her face to face?  
If I do that, 1st place is guaranteed 
;;;  
I'll be the first one if I can do that ㅎ <sup>[t/n: SInce they're roommates]</sup>
🫧 Binnie’s birthday is coming up soon too

? That's still so far away, it's next year
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋ

You're copying everything, even the shoes??"  
ㅋㅋ It's ridiculous.

Wow, that sounds good!  
I think she'd really like it.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Anything's fine, except a kiss…  
So I'll give something other than a kiss too, haha.  

🫧 "Binnie's birthday gift next year: a 2-hour solo concert viewing of Soomin."  

That's already available though…  
I'll just give myself to Soomin unnie as a gift.  
😊🫶🏻✌🏻🎁💝  
I don’t know. It’s a secret.  
Today, I'll aim for 1st place for sure.  
But can’t I just win with my natural voice?  
If I do that, 1st place is guaranteed anyway.  
;;;;  
Anyway, with my voice alone, I’m guaranteed 1st place, haha.  

🫧 "Binnie’s birthday is coming up soon too!"  

? But that's still far off next year.
