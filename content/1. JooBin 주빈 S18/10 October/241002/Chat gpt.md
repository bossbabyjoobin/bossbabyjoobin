Hi  
I’m hereeee  
🫧 Why are you here?  

?  
I’m leaving.  
.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Did you come early because you're sleepy?

Secretㅋ  
Just kidding.  
I came because I was thinking of WAV~~  
^~^~^  
🫧 Thanks for coming

I came because I missed you  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
ㅎ헤ㅔㅎ  
Today, I feel a bit like a human spinach  
I’m in a couple look with Soomin unnie  
So when I was putting on clothes earlier  
I told her,  
“Unnie, we’re matching outfits”  
And she said,  
“Ugh, why are you copying me? You even copied my shoes??”  
ㅋ It was ridiculous  
She said that…  
”Because it’s ‘almost-your-birthday’“  
…yeah  
That’s all I said..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Oh right, it’s Soomin’s birthday tomorrow. Did you prepare anything special this time?

If I tell you that,  
It wouldn’t be a secret, now would it? ^^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Maybe a tent for her bed? 

She already has one..  
The member who spread it to me is Soomin unnie  
ㅌㄱㅌㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 A birthday gift: a kiss!

Oh please  
No, that’s not it  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Cookies made with love by Binnie

Oh, that’s a good one  
She’d love it  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Cookies exploded with love by Binnie

What does that even mean?  
Soomin unnie knows how to make cookies too  
So I’ll pass on that  
🫧 What gift does Binnie want next year? 

Anything is welcomed except for a kiss..  
So, no kisses for me either  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Binnie’s birthday gift next year: a two-hour ticket to Soomin’s solo concert

She already has that..  
I’ll just give myself to Soomin unnie as a gift  
😊🫶🏻✌🏻🎁💝  
Who knows? It’s a secret  
Today, I’ll aim for 1st place  
But  
Can I just win with my voice?  
Guaranteed 1st place if so  
;;;  
With my voice, it’s a sure win ㅎ  
🫧 Binnie’s birthday is coming up soon too

? That’s way too far next year  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋ키ㅣ  
Time flies too fast  
Who should be the next guest on JooManSa?  
ㅎㅏ  
🫧 Let’s use a spinning wheel to decide

Oh, that’s good  
I’ll try it now  
Who’s left?  
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 13 14 16 19 20 21 22 23 24  
Right?  
Right, right?  
Okay, I’ll try  
Oh but  
The wheel only holds 8 choices…  
I’ll just do Coca-Cola later  
Giving up  
I’ll try now  
Oh  
I got it  
But this member  
Told me when they’d like to be called  
So it’s a pass for now..  
ㅎ  
I tend to consider requests  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ll decide well ^~^~^~^~^  
🫧 Binnie, recommend me something to eat

At this hour,  
You’re having dinner?????  
Okay  
I’ll recommend something between dinner and late-night snack  
But thinking of food  
Is making me hungry  
What are you gonna do about it  
It’s WAV’s fault  
ㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
Today’s recommendation is:  
Chicken pizza tteokbokki  
✨✨✨✨✨✨  
What’s with the question mark  
🫧 Wow, that’s genius!

Thanks for looking at it positively  
🫶🏻  
![[241002_S18_1.m4a]]  
Enjoy your meal  
🫧 Binnie recommended it, so even though I don’t want it, I guess I’ll have to order chicken

You sure you don’t want it?  
Suddenly, Hayun unnie turned around  
Guess why  
🫧 WANGWANGWAOANG <—-

Ah  
ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie, what do you think of the teaser VV released today?

It’s the vibe I like  
Hip hop girls!!!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Is Binnie’s casual fashion vibe like that?

N-not really  
But I like how the members look when they wear it  
^~^  
For me, I like  
Clean.. neat looks  
Cute neatness  
That’s what I prefer  
But even more than that, I like  
[y/n] ㅋ  
🫧 I like Binnie the most

Oh, we’re in sync  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I’m going to Busan tomorrow  
So  
I want some fish cake  
ㅜ  
ㅎ  
Fish cake  
Looks  
So cute and tasty  
Ah  
I’ll go practice now for tomorrow
