What are you up to?  
What are you doing?  
What’re you doing?  
What? What are you doing?  
Hehe  
I’m  
[y/n] just thinking  
That’s all.  
🫧 Oh, I was thinking about it too.  

^~^~^~^  
Turns out we're on the same page ^~^  
🫧 Congrats to BinLex, clap clap!  

Thank you, little squirrel  
⌚️⌚️⌚️✨✨✨✨  
Earlier,  
I was with Hayeon unnie and Seoyeon unnie  
The three of us took a stroll around the neighborhood  
Round and round  
Later, I’m going to meet Seollin unnie  
And give her a hug  
🫧 You looked so pretty today  

😶😉😚😚😚😚  
Thank you~  
ㅋㅋ  
🫧 So random, but I’m really hungry. Can you recommend something big to eat?  

Something big!!!!!! Bossam, Jokbal, and Makguksu!!!!!  
How about that?  
Or  
Chicken and Tteokbokki!!!!!!  
I had dumplings today  
🥟🥟🥟🥟🥟  
Five dumplings  
🫧 No wonder Joo recommended the dumpling hot pot earlier  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Eating together  
I had meat dumplings  
Nom  
🫧 What? Bin ate Bin? How does that work?!!  

I’m a human being.  
Dumplings  
Are in my stomach

VM (mandu mandu mandu mandu~)  
🫧 The members haven’t slept yet; you can hear their voices in the background.  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Meeting time with the VIVI members  
🫧 When you haven’t seen them in a while and finally meet, does it make you tear up?  

Today’s story  
I met with the VIVI unnies earlier today  
And shared some Japanese snacks I had in my bag  
With Tone unnie and Lynn unnie  
🫧 Earlier, you made a surprise appearance in Tone’s From  

Haha  
Appeared together  
With Jiyeon unnie  
🫧 Wow, Bin, you’re busy going here and there  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Right now, I was talking with Jiyeon unnie, then Shinwi unnie, then hugged Seollin unnie and talked with her  
🫧 I’m jealous, Bin. Are there any beds left in the dorm?  

ㅋㅋ  
Yeonji unnie said the couch is comfy.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Oh yeah, even if each person talks to one other, it’s like 23 conversations…  

ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bin, I’m finally home now… I miss you.  

Miss you so much~~~~~~  
Right now,  
I ordered a ton of soy milk and am organizing it  
Here’s the organizing method I’ll teach you  
1. Open the soy milk box  
2. Write a name on each soy milk… 48 times  
3. Stack them neatly!  
4. Put two separately in the fridge!  
And that’s it  
I’ll give you ASMR  
VM  
VM  
VM  
Writing the names is tiring  
So I just put a B and a ♡ somewhere in between  
VM  
Stacking them neatly~~~~  
Now, 24 are organized  
Still have 24 left  
But even if I organize it like this, if each Triple S member takes one, it’s gone in no time  
ㅎㅎ  
I’ll go finish organizing the soy milk now  
..  
Goodnight  
Dream of soy milk  
!!!!!  
Goodnight  
Goodbyeeee  
❤️  
VM (Annyeong)
