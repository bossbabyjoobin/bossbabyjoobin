Members showing interest in JooManSa, WAVs trying to get hints about who the next guest will be and her future plans for it 
 
#JooBin #주빈

🌊 I heard a rumor that the next guest for JooManSa is a foreign member?

Hoho
It's a secret
🌊 YooYeon unnie said she watched JooManSa and found it cute. She's looking forward to itㅋㅋ

Awesome😉
Now I'm getting love calls (t/n: members showing interest in JooManSa)
It's overflowing
Right, SoHyun unnie too
No, it's a problem because it's not easy to observe people
Now if I just stare at them for a little bit
Everyone will think it's them
"Oh, is it me?" Like that
???
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅜ
Even though I was just lookingㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🌊 JooBin, you need to start wearing sunglasses if you don't want to get caught looking

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🌊 Your secret got revealed in the first episode (t/n: her strategy in observing the guest)

Ha..
It's tough
ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Or maybe
Just keep staring at them one by one
So they won't know who it is
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ What do you think?
For real, I need to develop my observation skills
🌊 Did you sit next to SeoYeon on the bus to Ulsan to observe her? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋ Not really
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🌊 Now they'll just look in your eyes
🕶️
I'll put my sunglasses on right away
By the way, do you have any questions for the members?
I will ask them on your behalf on JooManSa
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🌊 Give us a hint about the next member so we can give you the right questions ㅎ

No, I'll prepare hard ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Look forward to the next episode
I'll do it brazenly 
^~^

Shared a story about how she found out that tooth fairies aren't real and how she will try to protect SeoAh's innocence in this matter

🌊 Bin, are you familiar with the tooth fairy?

🥕🥕🥕  
Oh right, I have a story about it  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
When I was young  
I put my tooth under the pillow  
Expecting to exchange it for a gift from the tooth fairy  
But the next day, there was nothing there and that's when I learned the truth...  
I found out too early  
But later, when playing with my cousin  
I saw my cousin doing the same thing as me  
So to protect my cousin's innocence  
I put my cherished candy and toy coins under my cousin's pillow……..  
🍭🪙  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Maybe  
It might have been too obvious  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅅㅋ  
🌊 Maybe your cousin protected your innocence too... (t/n: assuming her cousin  just played along)

...? Ah...  
🌊 ??: Unnie, it's really hard to protect your innocence

..........  
🌊 Let's do the same for SeoAh, let's put gifts under her pillow too  
Okay  
I will  
Protect  
SeoAh's  
Childhood innocence  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
