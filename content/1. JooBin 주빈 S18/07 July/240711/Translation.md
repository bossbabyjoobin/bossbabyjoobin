#JooBin #주빈

🌊 SeoYeon said she likes Binnie these days. How did you flirt with her?

ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ 
There's always a way
Today, I asked SeoYeon unnie to pick some picture for me 
Heh

You'll find out soon
or maybe not? ㅎ

JooBin making a wise choice by choosing SeoYeon

#JooBin #주빈

🌊 Binnie, If you were stranded on a deserted island, which member would you take with you?

Hmm
I would go with SeoYeon unnie
I think we would be able to escape quickly
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🌊She's just taking a member who's good at games

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

JooBin's preference for eating cereal and a WAV suggested a very interesting way to enjoy it

#JooBin #주빈

🌊 Does Binnie put cereal first or milk first?

Cereal!!
You pour cereal first
Then pour milk over it so the cereal doesn't get soggy 
It seeps into the cereal, it tastes better that way
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Even when poured like that, It doesn't get soggy
It's better to eat it crispy
Except for chocolate-flavored cereal

🌊 What do you think about putting cereal in your mouth and then drinking milk?

Ohh, that's interesting




🌊 이쯤에서 애교해야지 귀요미니까.

? 더 신박하네요
