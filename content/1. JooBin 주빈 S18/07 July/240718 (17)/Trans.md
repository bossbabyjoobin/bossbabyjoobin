#JooBin #주빈

🫧 You said you were going to see Lynn today. Did you go?

Yes ㅎㅎ
I gave the keyrings to the members
I bought one for each member that resembles them
Hehe
I spent an hour picking them out
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You bought 24 keyrings?

Yeah
🫧 Did you get one for yourself too since you bought 24 keyrings?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Yes
🫧 So, all 24 are different?

Bingo
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Can you tell me what you got for each member?

First, Pochacco for SeoYeon unnie 
A grey cat for HyeRin unnie🐱
A yellow bear for JiWoo unnie
A pink cat for ChaeYeon unnie
For YooYeon unnie, a white rabbit
Oh but YooYeon unnie and the other members are still in Japan
So I haven't given them their keyrings yet ㅜ
For the rest of the members
I got rabbit, cat, sheep, duck, ribbon and swan-like goose keyrings etc
I gave the purple ribbon to ChaeWon unnie🎀
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I gave the duck keyring to YeonJi unnie
It really looks like her, the one with the hat
Mine is a white cat, it's hanging from my phone
and I have a keyring that looks like a balloon dog too
Hehehe
I gave SeoAh a fluffy-looking dog keyring
I saw it and thought "This is perfect for SeoAh"
I put it in my basket right away
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
