JooBin shared a story about her name and whether she prefers Bin or JooBin and more 
 
 Do you ever wonder what JooBin's last name is?  
 
#JooBin #주빈

🫧 Tell us a story about having a two-syllable name

There are so many
One day
One of my closest friends and I were playing together in class
My friend suddenly looked at me with a deep in thought expression 
and asked "What was your last name, JooBin?"
?
?
?
..
Since then, whenever I introduce myself
"Hello, I'm JooBin"
"My last name is Joo"
"And my first name is Bin"
"It's a single-syllable first name" [KR: **외자**예요] (See notes below)
I do that
🫧 Did you do that too when you joined the company?

When I first met them and they asked my name
I said
"It's JooBin!"
"It's a single-syllable  first name!"
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Now
Even if they call me JooBin
It don't mind it
🫧 JooBin vs Bin? 

Bin..
hehe
🫧 Do the members call you JooBin more often or Bin?

But
I don't remember
I'm too used to both now
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But Bin is more common
Everyone finds it easier to call me Bin
Do you find it easier to call me JooBin?
I asked
They said I doesn't matter... It's still Bin ㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 OMG I never knew your name is a single-syllable name

?
...
Then, am I Joo JooBin?
......
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Suddenly
There's a lot of new last names appearing
..
🫧 Kwak JooBin

Sounds like a name of someone who will joke around a lot
.


___
[t/n: 외자 means a first name consisting of one syllable/character only.
As for Binnie, it's 빈 (Bin). 주(Joo) is her last name making it two syllables rather than the usual three. Korean given names (first name) are typically two syllables. 
e.g.: 윤**서연** Yoon SeoYeon, 정**해린** Jeong Haerin, 공**유빈**  Gong YuBin. 
Single-syllable names are not unheard of but are less common.
