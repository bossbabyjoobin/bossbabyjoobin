ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
My favorite ice cream.
Hmm
Yogurt, cookies & cream, chocolate.
Somewhere in between.
🫧 Oh, you have good taste.

For real.
🫧 It's strange. You're not the type to pick good food... Who are you? You're not Bin, right?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️ It's a fairy.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You like strawberry latte, but you don't like strawberry ice cream?

Oh, right.
Strawberry latte has the taste of biting into fresh strawberries.
It's just...
Yeah.
🫧 What did you do today, Bin?

Yesterday I talked about Jjapagetti,
And today I ate Jjajangmyeon.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 No, now I want to eat it too.

That's what I aimed for.
^~^
🫧 Sweet and sour pork. Do you pour the sauce or dip it?

Jjajang with Jjambbong broth.
Yum.
But sometimes,

I eat Jjambbong.
🫧 Hey. What's your favorite? (shortened form)

What about Bossam?
Sounds good? Okay, hahaha.

🫧 Tell us an episode about having a two-syllable name.

There are too many.
One day,
A friend I was close with
was playing in class,
Suddenly looked at me with a thoughtful expression,
And asked,
What's your last name, JooBin?
?
?

..
Since then,
When introducing myself,
Hello, I'm JooBin.
My last name is Joo,
And my name is Bin.
It's a single syllable.
🫧 ???: That friend is really good at introducing herself.

ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋ
Actually, it's no secret that I simulated it 50 times in my head before saying it.
🫧 Did you do that when you joined the company too?

When I first met someone and they asked my name,
I said,
I'm JooBin!
It's a single syllable!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Now,
Even if they call me JooBin,
It doesn't matter.
🫧 Do members call you JooBin more or Bin more?

But,
I can't remember.
I'm too
used to both.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But Bin is more common.
Everyone finds it easier to call me Bin.
Do you find it easier to call me JooBin?
I asked,
I don't mind... Bin. Hehe.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Wow, I didn't know you had a single syllable name.

?
...
I'm Joo JooBin.
......

Suddenly,
Many new last names
appeared.

🫧 Bring YeonJi to JooManSa.

Please save me.
I'll train and call her.
Oh, right.

🫧 Even if you get caught observing, will you proceed?

Of course.
There is no such thing as stopping in JooBin's dictionary.

🫧 Hearing this, Lin urgently averts her gaze.

I miss Lin unnie.
Instead of a surprise visit tomorrow,
I'll just go see her.
Hehe.
🫧 Let's go for a surprise visit now.
