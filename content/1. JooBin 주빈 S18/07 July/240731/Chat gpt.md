What should I do  
No  
I feel so unsettled  
Really  
🫧 My dearrrrrrrrr ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Hey, listen to me ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
I was exploring my gallery,  
and while looking back on the memories of Next,  
I got so sad...  
Sigh...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binna, you say you were young, but there's only a few months difference

No, it’s just that  
we feel things differently  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Is that all?

Yes!  
I wanted to make HaYeon unnie a seaweed soup as a birthday gift 
but I don't have enough time  
So, I have another idea  
ㅃㄹㅃㄹㅃㄹ  
Hey, wait a minute  
Ask her quietly from behind  
Oh, by the way  
today's Signal Live,  
before we started filming,  
HaYeon unnie asked, "Can you skate?"  
Yeahㅋㅋㅋ She was like, "I’m really good at it, huh"  
And I was like, “Oh no...  
I really can’t skate...  
I can only walk, though…”  
But when we got there,  
she was worse than me  
^~^  
Zunzze  
🫧 HaYeon said she was just acting

She’s explained a million times that  
she couldn’t help it because she wasn’t warmed up that day  
ㅎㅎㅎ Hehehe  
🫧 HaYeon said she wants a helicopter and an airplane

Oh  
A helicopter and an airplane  
You want toys, huh?  
How about a paper airplane  
and a bamboo copter?  
Is that possible?  
ㅎ  
🫧 Now she wants a building

That’s possible  
Tell her I'll get her a building in Blue Marble  
I’ll buy it  
as many as she wants  
🫧 Wow, buy one for me too

Sure, just say the word  
Blue? Yellow? Red?  
I’ll get you whatever you want  
🫧 Might as well make it red

Great, that’s the cheapest  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Binna, let’s write a letter within 18 minutes

Oh, but  
I told you, right?  
The Next unnies  
wrote me handwritten letters  
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹  
Even thinking about it now, I’m touched...  
Once again,  
I’ve been lost in memories…  
🫧 HaYeon says she wants cash

Tell her to go away  
ㅇㄴㅇㅇㅇㅇㅇ Hold on  
Really  
It was a mistake  
Please  
tell her  
tell her  
tell her  
🫧 Okay, calm down

Yeah!  
ㅎㅎ  
Last time, a WAV  
asked me,  
“Binna, do this and that for me”  
but there was a typo, so they said  
“Binna, I really didn’t mean that, it was a genuine mistake, I’m really sorry”  
I didn’t reply,  
but I laughed by myself...  
You  
made me smile  
I thank you  
I really need to write a letter  
But if I say this,  
they’ll say it again  
If they say it, they’re really  
bad  
WAVs  
really bad  
Don’t say it  
🫧 We’re supposed to have no secrets

Let’s make some secrets now  
Hello HaYeon unnie, I’m the Next maknae, JooBin  
How have you been?  
Make sure you eat well  
and don’t get sick  
Goodbye  
I wrote one line  
but I’m out of time  
For real  
I’ll write it  
nicely  
🫧 Just leave a lip mark and give it

Are you a genius?  
I should leave one  
You said you wanted a handwritten letter?  
I’ll write one for you  
Just say the word!!!!  
I’m good at writing letters  
Even in elementary school,  
I wrote so well  
that my homeroom teacher  
posted three of my writings  
on the class bulletin board as examples  
🫧 That’s really surprising

Maybe not *that* surprising...  
🫧 What did you write about?

Real poetic expressions  
So cool...  
Reminiscing…  
Something like, “As the moon sprinkled sleeping powder, I woke up, and it was morning.”  
Or something like that  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Maximum  
emotion  
for an elementary schooler  
🫧 But did you finish the letter?

Oh, right  
🫧 Seaweed flakes?

What seaweed flakes?  
I said sleeping powder, sleep  
This always happens  
I’m short on time  
and my battery is low  
Why do these trials  
come all at once…  
Ah...this is a problem...  
I’m really  
troubled by this  
There’s not much time left  
Why  
Ugh  
I’ll try to write quickly  
Sigh  
Ugh  
I wrote it wrong  
No, I can do this  
And I will  
leave the first birthday message  
Wait  
Leave the first message  
and wait a few minutes  
ㅇㄴ  
Oh no  
I  
really  
The Wi-Fi  
is slow,  
so it was late  
…..  
I give up  
But 4th place isn’t bad  
ㅎ  
It’s fine  
It’s the thought that counts  
Oh well  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Tone unnie is pretty fast  
ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Now,  
I’ll write the letter  
It’s perfect  
I’m going to give it  
Let’s go together  
I’m going to deliver it  
Midway  
Yoohoo  
VM1 38  
VM2 1:29  
It’s touching 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺  
Even though I wrote it...  
It’s so touching...  
Ahㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
Sigh  
Sighㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜ  
Tears, waaaahㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
No one’s actually crying  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I’m sad I can’t understand the voice message because I’m Japanese and I don’t speak Korean, but I’m still touched

ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
Right now,  
Next members are gathered,  
reminiscing through photos  
No,  
we’re watching old videos,  
and there are so many  
little clips like self-cams  
HaYeon unnie  
said, “Hello~ We’re the visual members of Next!”  
in such a calm tone  
Watching it...she’s still the same  
laughing ㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Don’t you think the vibe is a bit different now from when Next first formed?

Back then,  
it was like,  
Uh…awkward…white..!!  
But now it’s like,  
🥹😊🤨😘😜  
This kind of feeling  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I got into the fandom because of Next

🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺  
Right now, I’m feeling  
so fuzzy and warm about Next...  
It’s cheesy, but  
I’m really thankful and  
grateful  
It’s like that  
My first unit...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
🫧 Next’s forever maknae, Binna

Next’s forever beloved maknae, JooBin  
^^  
🫧 Ha,,, why do I love Next so much, Next forever, I totally love Next

ㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
Sigh  
I don’t know  
Today, I’m just  
feeling so good  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Anyone would think it’s Binna’s birthday

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋ  
I’m going to show my letter to Tone unnie  
And on her birthday,  
I’ll leave a kiss mark  
and give her a letter!  
Hehe  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋ  
🫧 Let’s write the letter a bit earlier for Tone’s birthday

Got it ㅎ  
🫧 I’ll leave a kiss mark on your birthday letter too… Ah… Is this okay…?

..That’s okay  
Should I start a kiss mark collection?  
🫧 At this rate, letter writing might become a tripleS tradition

I’ll make it happen  
ㅎ  
HaYeon unnie said,  
Oh, but I’m really touched  
It was calculated  
ㅎㅎㅎ  
Now, I should go to bed  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Off to bed, bed fairy!

🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️  
Let’s go  
VM3  
I shouted so much  
my voice is weird now  
🫧 JooBim--------------

Why are you calling  
Time went by so fast  
Missed the timing for the fairy’s entrance  
In that case,  
🧚🏻‍♀️Right now🧚🏻‍♀️
