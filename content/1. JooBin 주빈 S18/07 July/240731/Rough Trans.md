The build-up to HaYeon's birthday, JooBin's struggles writing a handwritten letter for HaYeon and NXT reminiscing about their training period together (long read...but it's worth it)

#JooBin #주빈

What should I do  
I'm getting upset
Really  
🫧 Jagiyaaaaaaaaaaaa ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Jagiya listen to me ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
I was checking my gallery
Looking back on memories of NXT
I got so sad...  
I was so young (back then)
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bin you say you were young but there's only a few months difference

No, it’s just that  
It feels different 
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 No way.. Is that all?

Yes!  
I wanted to make HaYeon unnie seaweed soup as a birthday gift
but I don't have enough time  
So I have another idea  
Ask her sneakily for me <sup>[t/n: on her fromm]</sup>
By the way, today's SIGNAL
before we started filming
I asked "HaYeon unnie, can you skate?"  
She was like "Yeahㅋㅋㅋ I’m really good at it"  
And I was like “Oh no... I really can’t skate...  I can only walk…”  
But when we got there,  she was worse than me  
^~^  
🫧 HaYeon said she was just acting

She explained a million times that it's because she wasn’t warmed up that day  
ㅎㅎㅎ허허
🫧 HaYeon said she wants a helicopter and an airplane

Oh  
A helicopter and an airplane  
You want toys huh?  
How about a paper airplane and a bamboo copter?  <sup>[t/n: bamboo copter = Doraemon's gadget]</sup>
Will that be enough instead?  
ㅎ  
🫧 Now she wants a building

That’s possible  
Tell her I'll get her a building in Blue Marble <sup>[t/n: it's a korean board game similar to Monopoly]</sup>  
I’ll buy her as many as she wants  
🫧 Buy one for me too

Sure 
Blue? Yellow? Red?  
I’ll get you whatever you want  
🫧 Might as well make it red

Great, that’s the cheapest  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Bin, let’s write a letter in 18 minutes

I mentioned this before, right?  
NXT unnies wrote me handwritten letters  <sup>[t/n: for her birthday]</sup>
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹  
Thinking about it again, I’m touched...  
Once again,  I’m lost in memories…  
🫧 HaYeon said she wants cash

Get out
Tell her that 
ㅇㄴㅇㅇㅇㅇㅇ Hold on  
Really  
It was a mistake  
Please  
Tell her that
Tell her that
Tell her that
🫧 Okay, calm down

Yes!  
ㅎㅎ  
Last time, a WAV said "Binne, ......" this that so on and so forth 
But there was a typo, so they said  
“Binnie, I really didn’t mean that, it was a genuine mistake, I’m really sorry”  
I didn’t reply but I laughed by myself...  
You made me smile  
I thank you  
I really need to write a letter now 
🫧 We’re supposed to have no secrets

Let’s make some secrets now  
I've only written
"Hello HaYeon unnie, I’m NXT's lovely maknae, JooBin"
"How have you been? Make sure you eat well and don’t get sick. Bye"
I’m out of time  
For real  
I'll try to write it nicely
🫧 Just leave a kiss mark and give it

Are you a genius?  
I should leave one  
You said you wanted a handwritten letter?  
I’ll write one for you  
Just say the word!!!!  
I’m good at writing letters  
Even in elementary school 
My writing was so good that my homeroom teacher posted three of my pieces on the class bulletin board as examples
🫧 That’s really surprising

I don't think it's that surprising……
🫧 What did you write about?

Real poetic expressions  
So cool...  
Reminiscing…  
Something like “As the moon sprinkled sleeping powder, I woke up, and it was morning"  
It's something like that  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Maximum emotion for an elementary student
🫧 But did you finish the letter?

Ah right..  
🫧 Seaweed flakes? <sup>[t/n: a WAV is joking around, the spelling is similar, 김**가루** = Seaweed flakes, 잠**가루** = Sleeping powder]</sup>

What do you mean seaweed flakes?  
I said sleeping powder, sleep  
This always happens  
I’m short on time and my battery is low  
Why do these issues come all at once…  
Ah...this is a problem...  
I’m really troubled by this  
There’s not much time left  
Why  
Ugh  
I’ll try to write quickly  
`*Sigh*`
I wrote it wrong  
No, I can do this  
`[Waiting for midnight to greet HaYeon...]`
I need to be the first one to greet her
The WiFi is slow  
so it was late  
…..  
I gave up  
But 4th place isn’t bad  
ㅎ  
It’s fine, It’s the thought that counts  
 ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Tone unnie is pretty fast  
ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Now,  l’ll write the letter  
`[after a few minutes..]`
It’s perfect
I’m going to give it to HaYeon unnie
Let’s go together  
I’m going to deliver it  
Midway  
Yoohoo

`*HBD song playing while entering HaYeon's room*`
`🍞Both of you are doing fromm`
`*🐣Sings HBD*`
`🐣I'm going to give you a letter  `
`🍞Ohhhh letter, I'm touched`
`🐣NXT is gathered here`
`🐣Even though Lynn unnie isn't here `
`🐣It's so touching `
`🦔Can I read it?  `
`🐣Yes, read it `
`🦔"HaYeon unnie, Hello unnie"`
`🐣🍞 NXT is gathered here`<sup>[Lynn's there now too]</sup>





`🦔 "I heard you wanted this. With just 10 minutes left, I’m scribbling away, so please understand if my handwriting is a bit messy. I looked through all the pictures and videos we took together during NXT. And I got completely immersed in the memories. It made me really sad but at the same time, it was a bit bittersweet. I could feel all the mixed emotions. When we first met, it wasn’t all good times, but I’m still glad that we’ve made it this far. I remember thinking you were pretty when we first met. When we took the bus together, I’m glad I tried to talk to you on the bus so we can get closer to each other. I was the 4th person to send you birthday greetings, please congratulate me. Thank you for being by my side when things were tough and for being by my side in times of happiness. I hope we can continue to rely on each other. Happy birthday! Sweet dreams, love you"`

`🐣You have to look at the bottom too`
`🐣I left a kiss mark there` 
`🦔I thought it was a mountain`  
`🦔You really did it!`

It’s so touched 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺  
Even though I wrote it myself...  
It’s so touching...  
ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ    
Tears pouringㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
No one’s actually crying  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I’m sad I can’t understand the voice message because I’m Japanese and I don’t speak Korean, but I’m still touched

ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
Right now, NXT members are gathered reminiscing over our old pictures and videos  
We’re watching old videos and there are so many short clips like self-cams  
HaYeon unnie said in a very calm tone “Hello~ We’re the visual members of NXT!”  
Watching it...she’s still the same  
ㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Don’t you think the vibe is a bit different now from when NXT first formed?

Back then, it was like
Uh…awkward.!!  
But now it’s like
🥹😊🤨😘😜  
This kind of feeling  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I became a fan because of NXT

🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺  
Right now, I’m feeling  
so soft and warm about NXT...  
It’s cheesy but  
I’m really thankful and grateful  
My first unit...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
🫧 NXT's forever maknae, JooBin

NXT’s forever lovely maknae, JooBin  
^^  
🫧 Ha,,, why do I love NXT so much, NXT forever, I totally love NXT

ㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
*Sigh*
I don’t know  
Today, I’m just feeling so good  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Anyone would think it’s Binnie’s birthday

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋ  
I bragged about my letter to Tone unnie  
On her birthday, I’ll leave a kiss mark  
and give her the letter!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋ  
🫧 Let’s write the letter a bit earlier for Tone’s birthday

Got it ㅎ  
🫧 I’ll leave a kiss mark on your birthday letter too… Ah… Is this okay…?

..That’s okay  
Should I start a kiss mark collection?  
🫧 At this rate, letter writing might become a tripleS tradition

I’ll make it happen  
ㅎ  
HaYeon unnie said "Oh but I’m really touched"  
I was aiming for that
ㅎㅎㅎ
