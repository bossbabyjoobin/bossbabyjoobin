What are you dong?
What’s up? 
Not sleeping??
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Binnie 👇🏻🖐🏻🤨 sleep! 

Sry….
Why is no one sleeping?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You stay up waiting for me

ㅇAh really??
Sorry, you shouldn’t wait..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’ll try to come earlier from now on
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ
But I’ll probably come whenever I want
🤍🤍🤍🤍
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I missed you, Fairy

Me..???????
🫧 Me too...

What do you mean, "me too"?
🫧 Because Fairy always responds so well

^^
I’m good at it too
Is she being coy?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Our country won the gold medal in the team archery event in the Olympics!

🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Great job!!!
🫧 Binnie, did you go out today? It’s seriously unbearably hot,,

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I heard it’s really hot today
But I didn’t stay outside for long
So I don’t really know
🫧 It’s annoying, so I thought of you!

Should I be thankful for that
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
What did you do today? Did you see Kotone's first pitch?
The unnies who went for the first pitch
were complaining about the heat
I realized
that the weather is getting hotter and hotter
🫧 Isn’t there a weather fairy to make it cool?

The fairy is just a fairy..
Not sure about weather control…
..
Why are you bothering our fairy
It’s not that she’s incompetent
It’s just that weather isn’t her main job.
🫧 What’s the fairy’s main job?

Making appearances!
^~^~^~^~^
🫧 Because the fairy is cute, I’ll let it slide ㅎㅎ

🧚🏻‍♀️Yay~!!🧚🏻‍♀️
🫧 Handling important tasks

Pretty important
🫧 Fairy, please tell us if Binnie bothers you!!

That won’t happen..! ㅜㅜㅜ
The fairy
The fairy also
melts in the weather
so she has a hard time in the summer
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Stop calling the fairy
I should make her disappear
ㅎㅅㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Shall I tell you something shocking?
It’s Monday past midnight….
Mon
Day
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Hold on
SooMin unnie
I don’t know
what she’s talking about
it’s really never-ending
🫧 JooBin can’t multitask??

I can’t multitask
but this is
beyond multitasking
Oh
seems like it’s over
Sorry, I’m back
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 The topic changes every 5 seconds, can you follow?

The topic changes every 5 seconds
so I don’t know
🫧 So would you live with YeonJi or SooMin?

No
What kind of question is this
I’ll just live with you…
Admitting it…
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Binnie, good morning

It’s good midnight now
Midnightflower
`~~~~~~~~~~~`
🫧 Suddenly, what’s your favorite B-side track?

It’s always Chiwoo ㅎㅎ
But
these days it’s
Midnightflower
🫧 Oh, totally opposite of me.

I thought it was the same;
Maybe it’s because it’s dawn
🫧 I want some late-night snacks

I was getting emotional from the messages above, but
you ruined it
..
Eat naengmyeon as a late-night snack
^~^
🫧 But when you recommend late-night snacks, don’t you not want to eat them?

Usually, when I do From,
I’ve already finished my bedtime routine
so
if I think of it, I’ll eat it the next day~~~
that kind of feeling
🫧 Are you still on the no late-night snacks challenge?

Yes
If I eat late-night snacks
I can’t digest
🫧 Do you actually eat it the next day? Or do you forget and eat something else?

I try to eat it the next day
but I don’t really crave it
so if there’s something I want to eat in the afternoon,
I eat that
🫧 You’re just doing whatever you want ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

ㅎㅎㅎㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅌㄱㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Tell us how you satisfy your cravings with just the smell of food, JooBin

I wonder if there are any WAVs who relate to this
it’s like when I’ve already done my bedtime routine
and I smell late-night snacks
🫧 No

? I haven’t finished yet
No
listen
don’t argue yet
when I smell late-night snacks, it’s like
it smells good🥹🥹
that kind of feeling..
……
Sorry
JiYeon unnie always
thinks it’s weird
but it’s really like that…
🫧 We think it’s weird too

..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Let’s move on ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You and From are always bickering, it’s cute
🫧 What to do ㅋ

Seriously
🫧 쀅

Childish ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 That’s a skill too

WAVs have amazing skills.
🫧 Let’s have a From full of love from now on ㅎㅎ

Yes ㅎㅎㅎ sounds good
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🧚🏻‍♀️
It’s really interesting
Everyone looks for the fairy around the same time
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️
So I should come out ㅎㅎ
🫧 Irresistible charm

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Binnie, I want to make a playlist, recommend some songs..

My playlist
when I did From before,
I recommended a song each time
if you gather them all, it’s complete
I’ll tell you what I recommended
Honesty-PinkSweat$
Never Not-Lauv
always ill care-Jeremy Zucker
MyLoveMineAllMine-Mitski
IntrusiveThoughts-Natalie Jane
Lovely-Billie Eilish
Forest-Sunbaenim Choi Yu Ri
Rose-Sunbaenim Miyeon
Antifreeze-Sunbaenim Baek Yerin
and so on, there are too many
The fairy too!!
I listen to so many
various kinds
so I don’t think genre is that important
🫧 Let’s try heavy metal too

Challenge accepted
Rockstar
🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸
🫧 Heavy metal wings~~

What is that
Last time during practice with the members
someone was singing heavy metal wings
I unconsciously sang along
and thought the song was really good
for 3 seconds
? What song was I singing along to???
then alone
ah
!!!!!!!!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Just subconsciously
I was singing along because I liked it…
Now I’m listening to it
🫧 So what’s the criteria for adding songs to your playlist?
Melody? Beat? Emotions? Or just whatever you like?

I separate pop songs
and emotional..? songs
and listen to what I want
🫧 Relatable: having more than 5 playlists ㅋㅋ

Oh
….
Got me
I have almost 10
🫧 Wow, can’t relate, I’m a P, I get tired of managing it, so I just make a mixed one..

ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Once you get hooked on a song, do you listen to it until you’re sick of it?

Yes, mostly?
🫧 How long have you listened to a single song?

Um
I don’t know, but
really a lot
Listening to songs
makes me sleepy
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Heavy metal wings makes you sleepy?

The song after heavy metal wings makes me sleepy~~~
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’m going to sleep
ㅎㅎ
🫧 Did you skip a tripleS song?

Listened to it all and then automatically skipped ㅎ
Bye
🫧 Bye, come again…will wait….

I should text Jiwoo unnie
Good night
Bye
🤍🤍
Bye
