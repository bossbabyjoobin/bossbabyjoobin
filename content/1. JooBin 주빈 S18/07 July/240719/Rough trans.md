🫧 How come only SooMin gets Jeonju Choco Pie? What about the rest of us? 


..?
When did I ever say that here? 
Every time I see this kind of stuff out of the blue [t/n: info that came from other members fromm]
I get surprised
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 If you give something to a member, won’t it be misunderstood as an ‘invitation’ to appear on JooManSa?

So I sent this in our group chat
"The choco pie is in the fridge, so feel free to grab it if you want some"
"(Pic)"
It was definitely there yesterday
Now there's only one left
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Can I eat the last one?

Yes ㅎㅎㅎ
What if 
I make it
Like the Choco Jam??
What do you think???
????????
Wait a minute
Can I get some reaction

`For Context: Choco jam is an inside joke in JooBin’s fromm. She planned to eat a choco cake during her solo SIGNAL LIVE, so she baked it before going to bed, but it turned into jam (due to incorrect measurements of ingredients, etc) which is why WAVs reacted the way they did ㅋㅋㅋ To add fuel to the fire, the general consensus is that WAVs don't trust her cooking due to lack of "proof". Look forward to her Cooking SIGNAL in the future, she said she needs to do one to prove her cooking skills ㅋㅋ`
