Talked about the Omniscient Interfering View episode and other shenanigans inside the dorm
 
#JooBin #주빈


🌊Watching The Manager, I've noticed that the members all had similar stuff ㅋㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋ You're right
If one person buys something
"What's that?"
"Ooh, I want to buy that too"
"Omg, me too"
"What are you buying?"
"I'll buy that too"
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🌊 Who usually sets the trends in the dorm?

Uhm...
It changes every time
To be honest, I don't know
Once one person buys something, it spreads around and eventually all 24 members have it
It just goes like that
🌊 Is there anything that JooBin has spread around?

👉🏻✋🏻
Still stuck with only 8 members 
It hasn't spread to the other members yet
🌊 Turns out you're sharing a room with SooMin, I thought you were in different rooms

.. The number one reason why I always get attacked
🌊 The day you said "I love you" to Kotone, I realized just how far you've come just to say that to her.. That's definitely love.. ㅋㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ Bingo
I  even went downstairs to tell her that 
🌊 tripleS is full of love

[VM] My love ~

Thoughts after the first episode of JooManSa, how she picked SeoYeon as the first guest and how she observed SeoYeon

#JooBin #주빈


🌊When is the next episode of JooManSa coming out... I'm really looking forward to it..

ㅎㅅㅎ
The first episode of JooManSa
It's still very awkward
I couldn't be as bold as I wanted to..
But for episode 2, I'll come with a bolder attitude 😉..👉🏻
The guests 
It's not fixed, It's random
ㅎㅎ
Spur of the moment kind of thing
"Ah, in this episode, it's this member" something like that
Heh
🌊 But still, you wanted to do it with S1 for the first episode

You're right,  since it's the start
I really wanted to do it with SeoYeon unnie
🤍🤍
JooBin's pick
🌊 How long did you observe Seoyeon?

Observing her wasn't that easy...
I didn't even know I was caught
🌊 Bin, did you also drink packaged milk?? (t/n: milk in cartons)

I like milk and I also drink it often
But when SeoYeon unnie bought packaged milk and drank it
It looked delicious so I bought some too 😎😎

🌊 So, in JooManSa, JooBin is the guest and the members are the hosts, right?

Unbelievable
It's People Who Met JooBin
It's not the other way around
