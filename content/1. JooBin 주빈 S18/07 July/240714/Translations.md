ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Hi
I just finished watching JooManSsaLove, can't wait for the next episode.. I'm really excited.

ㅎㅅㅎ
Episode 1 of JooManSsa was a bit awkward at first,
I couldn't be as bold as I wanted to..
But for episode 2, I'll come with a bolder attitude 😉..👉🏻
The guests aren't fixed, it's spontaneous
Haha
Randomly,
"Oh, it's them for this episode!!" kind of thing
Heh
🌊 But still, I wanted to be with Number 1 in episode 1

And I really wanted to start with SeoYeon unnie
🤍🤍
Bin-pick.
🌊 How much guest observation did you do?

Observation...
It wasn't that easy...
I didn't even know I was caught
🌊 Did Bin also drink packaged milk??

I naturally like milk and drink it often,
But when unnie bought packaged milk and started drinking it, it looked good so I bought some too 😎😎
🌊 Watching JeonChamSsi, members have similar items kekeke

Kekeke a mess
One person buys it
"Oh, what's that?"
Oh, I want one too
Oh, me too
? What are you buying?
I want one too
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Repeat
🌊 Who usually leads trends in the dorm?

It's different every time
I really don't know
Just one person buys something and eventually all 24 of us have it
Like that
🌊 Did JooBin start any trends?

👉🏻✋🏻
Actually, it's still stuck at 8 people
Trend halted
🌊 SooMin and I were in the same room, I thought it was a different room

.. Reason why I'm attacked every day
🌊 When I told KotoNe I love them that day, it really came a long way.. This is definitely love.. kekeke

Kekeke bingo
I went downstairs and delivered the message
🌊 Triple S's love is overflowing

🌊 Are you confident that you won't lose the lead in the next JooManSsa?

Haha fighting
I'm going to get bolder
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Every time
It gets awkward
🌊 So, in JooManSsa, Bin is the guest and the members are the hosts, right?

?

Unbelievable
The people Bin met
Not the people Bin met
...
Not the people Bin met
