JooBin fell for Kotone's charms even before joining tripleS and their suspiciously matching food taste

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 Bin, what did you eat for dinner?

I had pizza with Tone unnie today
🍕🍕
🫧 Was it sweet potato pizza?

????? How did you know
We ate sweet potato cheese crust pizza and cheese puffs 
Tone unnie and I have the exact same taste in food..
😮🥹😮🥹😮🥹
My Gong Cha pick is quite unique but somehow we have the same one
Whenever I say "What should I order?"
She'd be like "Wow I was thinking of getting that too"
Today while eating pizza
I thought cheese puffs would be delicious
and then Tone unnie shouted "cheese puffs!!"
...We were on the same wavelength
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Out of 24 people, at least two must have similar tastes, right..

ㅋㅋㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Actually, I never said this but before I joined tripleS
I had many reasons to become a fan
But the main reason was a short video of Tone unnie smiling at the camera
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
So back then, I thought "her smile is so pretty.."
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It's a secret
Even though she'll find out about it later 
🫧 I think they're already there informing Tone about it 

..I think so too
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Bin, you're always with Kotone these days ㅋㅋ Do you like her too?

👉🏻👈🏻🤍
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 What should I do?  Binnie is becoming my bias lately?

What do you mean "What should I do"
You can just like me
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 So Binnie, were you already a WAV before you became an S?

Before I became a big S
I was already a WAV
ㅎㅅㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 I'm curious about your Gong Cha pick

I have a few
The same one as Tone unnie is Mango Yogurt with Black Pearls
If you opt for black pearls, everyone says mango yogurt is supposed to go with white pearls…
But it was the first time I saw two of the same orders on the order slip
So I was like
"Huh?"
"Who else ordered this besides me"
It turns out it was Tone unnie
Seriously, it's delicious
You should try it
Highly recommended

JooBin's resemblance to a turtle and how the members teased her 

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 Why did you give a koala keyring to ShiOn? ㅋㅋ

Between NXT members, we said ShiOn unnie looked like a koala
Then when I went to buy keyrings
I saw this tiny cute koala..
and thought "🥹This is ShiOn unnie"
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But that koala really did look cute
🫧 But why are you a turtle, Binnie?

..I don't know
When I was practicing with NXT members 
When we were eating together
They would always say "Oh! It's a turtle!!!"
When Aria sunbaenim's music video came out, they said
"Oh!! Binnie!!
"When did you appear in the music video!!!"
…………..
They said my mouth shape when I eat looks like a turtle's mouth
That's what they said
🫧 There's a resemblance

..You don't have to fact-check it..
🫧 Actually, Binnie, you're Pororo

?
Ah, even HyeRin unnie gave me a turtle keyring because I looked like one
ShiOn unnie agreed that I looked like one
……

🫧 Oh no, now WAVs will watch closely every time you eat

I won't eat in front of WAVs
🫧 Suddenly, I want to see Binnie doing a mukbang

..
I won't eat
 twe <sup>[KR: 퉤] <sup>[t/n: spitting sound]</sup></sup>
🫧 If you're doing a Cooking Signal, you need to taste the food too

I'll turn around and taste it
ㅋ
🫧 After seeing this, I'm going to rewatch the lunch time part in Badge War 2

Ah, but in Badge War
I probably ate
Waaaaay too much
🫧 Were you very hungry then, Binnie?

👍🏻
From now on
I'll be conscious of how I eat in front of WAVs
..
I urgently need to change the topic
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🥳🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️
By the way, who was it
Was it HaYeon unnie
While we were eating during practice
She suddenly stared at me and said
"Oh, Binnie really chews her food like 'omul omul'
It's not 'waang' or 'yam yam'
Out of all the people I've seen you're the first one to eat exactly like 'omul omul'"
Then later, another member said
"Wow, what HaYeon said last time is true. Binnie really eats like 'omul omul'"
I had no idea either but during practice the unnies told me
..????????!?!??!?
🫧 Don't let it slide, that's flirting

?
Okay
From now on, when I flirt,
I'll say, "You chew your food like 'omul omul'..? hehe"
Got it
🫧 Oh my gosh, that's so fluttering

..?
This works
🫧 No other girl has said that to me before

🫧 빈이가 아이돌이 된 계기는?

엄마가 알려줬는데
난 내가 아이돌을 꿈으로 둔 적이 없다고 생각했었거든
근데 난 어릴 때
장래희망을 적을 때면
친구들 다 의사 판사 변호사
적는데
나 혼자
가수
라고 적었었댜
적었었대
🫧 사실 본능적으로 원래의 꿈을 쫒은거구나?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ모루겠지만
그랬납
운명인가봐
근데 생각해보면 항상 그랬었어
노래 듣고 부르고 좋아해서
티비에 가수분들 나오시면
다 멋져보이고
결론은 나도 모르는 새에
이미 꿈을 향해 가고 있었다

JooBin's journey becoming an idol

[240728] 🐣💭 01:046 AM KST

JooBin never dreamed of becoming an idol in the first place

#JooBin #주빈


🫧 What made you become an idol, Binnie?

My mom told me to
I thought I had never dreamed of becoming an idol
But when I was young
While my friends wrote their dreams as doctors, judges and lawyers
I was the only one who wrote "singer"
🫧 So you were instinctively following your original dream?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I don't know
Maybe it was destiny
But looking back, I always liked it
Listening to songs and singing it
Watching singers on TV, I thought they were so cool
In the end, without even knowing
I was already heading toward my dream
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Into the ever-growing dream~~~~~ <sup>[KR: 매일매일 커져가는 꿈속으로]  <sup>[t/n: Referencing to Girls' Capitalism Lyrics]</sup></sup>

~~~
These are my thoughts that are unrelated to what JooBin said on fromm. 

I deeply appreciate how much JooBin has opened up over the past seven months, especially given how reserved she was before. Seeing her share personal stuff and express more love towards the members makes me very happy. By sharing these translations and highlighting how adorable/lovely JooBin is, I hope this encourages many more people to show their love and support for her.
