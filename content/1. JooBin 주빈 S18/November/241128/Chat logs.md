JooBin got sulky after the video call with Tone

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 JooBin-ah!! I heard you had a video call with Kotone???

Oh, that's right  
When JiYeon unnie was talking to her
I was right next to her 
At that moment, I realized she didn’t call me
she called JiYeon unnie instead… ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
So I said to Tone unnie 
"Unnie!!!! Why do you always call JiYeon unnie and never me!!!!!!!"  
And she was like
"No, no! I was totally going to call you if JiYeon didn’t pick up"  
So I said "Oh, so I’m not your first choice after all???!?!?!!"  
And got all sulky
Hmph
Tsk

🫧 Then what did Kotone say?

I don’t know
Hmph  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I even sent her selfies  
and heart emojis through text 
but she’s so mean……..  
I’m going to sulk for three days
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
I'm fine...

`[18 minutes later...]`  

🫧 When Kotone video called JiYeon, she said seeing you next to her really recharged her^_^

Is that so?  
I even saw the first snow of the year and thought of Kotone unnie, so I recorded a video of the snow piling up  
and sent it to her
I even texted her “Unnie, it’s snowing so much here!”  
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍

`[t/n: This is so sweet. In Korea, the first snow holds a lot of meaning and the fact that JooBin thought of Kotone...ಥ‿ಥ]`

Xinyu pulled a K-drama move on Binnie and kissed her 

#JooBin #주빈
___

🫧 JiYeon said people's hearts change on NPOP……

I’ll change mine too…………..  
Anyway, a new love appeared yesterday
While we were practicing  
I took a short break and sat down next to Xinyu unnie
Out of nowhere, Xinyu unnie brought her lips close to my face
I was like *“Huh? What’s this?”*  
But then she backed off
So I thought *“Uhh.. okay?”*  
But all of a sudden, her lips came closer again
and before I knew it, she kissed me 

…After HaYeon unnie and Lynn unnie  
this was the first time I had been kissed by someone else in a while
I was so flustered like _“What just happened?”_
but Xinyu unnie goes
"Do you usually just stay still when someone gets close to you?"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Like, who would expect it to be a kiss??  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I just said “Yes….”  
And she was like
"*Okay*, **now there’s one more** *member* **added to my kiss list**"<sup>[*EN*]</sup><sup>[**KR**]</sup>

`[t/n: the mix of KR and EN is just like how Xinyu speaks ^~^]`  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 I can literally hear Xinyu's voice while while reading that ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 


ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Is SooMin really that loud? (Part 2)

#JooBin #주빈
___
🫧 Is the room quiet without SooMin? ㅋㅋ

It’s really quiet
We spend more time in the practice room than in the HAUS (these days) 
and with all 16 of us gathered in the practice room 
you don’t feel the difference as much...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 So you’re saying one person equal to 16 people??

A little bit?  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
