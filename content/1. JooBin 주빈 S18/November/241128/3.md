🫧 Is the room quiet without SooMin? ㅋㅋ

It’s really quiet
We spend more time in the practice room than in the HAUS (these days)
and with all 16 of us gathered in the practice room 
you don’t feel the difference as much...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 So you’re saying one person equal to 16 people??

A little bit?
