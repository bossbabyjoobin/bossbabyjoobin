🫧 JooBin-ah!! I heard you had a video call with Kotone???

Oh, that's right  
When JiYeon unnie was talking to her
I was right next to her 
At that moment, I realized she didn’t call me
she called JiYeon unnie instead… ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
So I said to Tone unnie 
"Unnie!!!! Why do you always call JiYeon unnie and never me!!!!!!!"  
And she was like
"No, no! I was totally going to call you if JiYeon didn’t pick up"  
So I said "Oh, so I’m not your first choice after all???!?!?!!"  
And got all sulky
Hmph
Tsk

🫧 Then what did Kotone say?

I don’t know
Hmph  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I even sent her selfies  
and heart emojis through text 
but she’s so mean……..  
I’m going to sulk for three days
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
I'm fine...

`[18 minutes later...]`  

🫧 When Kotone video called JiYeon, she said seeing you next to her really recharged her^_^

Is that so?  
I even saw the first snow of the year and thought of Kotone unnie, so I recorded a video of the snow piling up  
and sent it to her
I even texted her “Unnie, it’s snowing so much here!”

`[t/n: This is so sweet. In Korea, the first snow holds a lot of meaning and the fact that JooBin thought of Kotone...ಥ‿ಥ]`
