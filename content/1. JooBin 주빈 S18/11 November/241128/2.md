Xinyu pulled a K-drama move on Binnie and kissed her

🫧 JiYeon said people's hearts change on NPOP……

I’ll change mine too…………..  
Anyway, a new love appeared yesterday
While we were practicing  
I took a short break and sat down next to Xinyu unnie
Out of nowhere, Xinyu unnie brought her lips close to my face
I was like *“Huh? What’s this?”*  
But then she backed off
So I thought *“Uhh.. okay?”*  
But all of a sudden, her lips came closer again
and before I knew it, she kissed me 
…After HaYeon unnie and Lynn unnie  
this was the first time I had been kissed by someone else in a while
I was so flustered like _“What just happened?”_     
but Xinyu unnie goes
"Do you usually just stay still when someone gets close to you?"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Like, who would expect it to be a kiss??  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I just said “Yes….”  
And she was like
"*Okay*, **now there’s one more** *member* **added to my kiss list**"<sup>[*EN*]</sup><sup>[**KR**]</sup>
`[t/n: the mix of KR and EN is just like how Xinyu speaks ^~^]`  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I can literally hear Xinyu's voice while while reading that ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
