[VM1] ~ [WAVs hello]
🫧 You looked pretty today, hmph.

Why are you sulking?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
You only wanted to see me?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Cute.
But why aren’t you sleeping?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Well,
🫧 I got used to waiting as long as possible for you to come before I sleep.

…
No,
I came because I thought of you before sleeping.
If you interrupt JuJu🤍🌊's sleep
……
Hehe
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Ah
🫧 Are you really sleeping while leaving us alone...?

ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Yes, I’ll just keep coming ^~^
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
[VM2]
🫧 Are there no ghosts in Binnie’s dorm?

?
How did ghosts come up?
Instead, fairies appear
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️
Chaewon unnie and Yeonji unnie
keep saying weird things.
They keep hearing knocking sounds.
That was actually me ^~^
Just kidding
ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Hahaha
🫧 What time does Binnie usually fall asleep?

Usually after finishing From, around the time I say I’m flying to dreamland.. ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Every day, I share my bedtime.
😀😀😀😀
🫧 But why does Sumin only get Jeonju Choco Pies? Why don’t we get any?

..?
When did I say that?
It’s not the first time I’m surprised by news like this while being totally unaware.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Huh
🫧 If you give something to a member, wouldn’t they think it’s a proposal to appear on JooManSa?

For that, I sent it to our group chat.
“I put Choco Pies in the fridge, eat if you want.”
(photo)
It was definitely there yesterday,
but now there’s only one left.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Can I eat the last one?

Yes ㅎㅎㅎ
How about
I make it like chocolate jam??
How about that???
????????
Wait a moment,
a bit of a reaction.
.
[VM]
Phew….
🫧 Today, too, feeling restless

Restless team,
the best ^~^

🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️
The fairy doesn’t know aegyo.
^~^~^~^
🫧 Fairy, is Binnie wearing glasses now?

No, because she’s lying down,
she’s not wearing them.
She doesn’t usually wear them,
only when she really needs to see something.
ㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Fairy, do you sleep too?

Of course,
I have to sleep.
🧚🏻‍♀️💤💤💤💤💤
Fairies also eat, sleep, and work overtime.
Just like everyone else.
🫧 Do fairies only work during From?

Yes, that’s their main job.
Only working overtime.
🫧 There’s a bug in the room.. Fairy, save us…

Aaaahhhh
🫧 Fairy, if you’re tired because of JooBin today, raise a carrot.

🥕👆🏻
🫧 Cook ramen, I’m hungry.

🔥💧🫕🍜
Fairy is logging off.
Leaving work on time.
The fairy’s eyes
are closing.
Not JooBin,
the fairy.
🫧 Binnie is still full of energy, right?

Not really.
🫧 Then do an acrostic poem with JooBin.

Ju-reong ju-reong
Bin-dae tteok
Sorry
..
🫧 Sorry, do an acrostic poem.

Mi-rae-e-neun
An-mian-ham
Sorry……..
🫧 I’ll give you another chance with ‘Fairy.’

Fairy yoyo!!
Really sorry……….
There’s a saying,
“It’s better not to be funny at all than to be awkwardly unfunny.”
….
🫧 You made that up, right?

Yes, I’m sorry.
The beginning was weak,
and the end was weak too.
…
ㅎㅎㅎ효ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Binnie, you’re very sleepy, it’s time to sleep now.

See you tomorrow.
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Or maybe later?

Ah, right,
