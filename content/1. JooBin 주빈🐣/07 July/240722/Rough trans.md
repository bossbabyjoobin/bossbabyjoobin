🫧 빈이 어릴때 웃긴썰 궁금해

난 별로  
웃긴인간이 아니였어서  
내 인생이  
재밌긴 한데  
지극히 내 기준  
이라  
남이보기지루해도 내가재밌으면됐지ㅋ  
라는 마인드..?  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 약간 민망한 웃긴 에피소드는 있는데 부끄러울듯

많긴 해.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
친구들이랑 학교에서  
캠프? 갔는데  
부모님이랑 같이 가는  
그런 캠프였거든  
그래서 버스 타고 이동하고  
도착해서 막 들뜬 마음으로 내렸지  
내려서 이제  
친구들 다 아빠랑 막 손 잡고 가니까  
나도 아빠 찾아서  
뛰어가서 안겼는데  
..오 친구 아버님이시네  
…………  
3초 아니고 5초 동안 어색했어  
내아빠를 찾아…  
다시 갔..다  
근데 내가 냅다 뛰어가서 안긴 아버님이  
다행..인지 친한친구 아버님이셨어  
해피.엔딩 ^~^  
진짜머쓱뻘쭘그자체

그친구는 아마  
모를거양……..

🫧 I'm curious about funny stories from Binnie's childhood

I'm so so
I wasn't really a funny person
My life is interesting to me, even if others might find it boring
As long as I enjoy it, that's what mattersㅋ
That's the kind of mindset I have..?
^~^

🫧 Do you have any funny but slightly embarrassing stories that you’re a bit hesitant to share

There are a lot
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I went to a camp with my friends from school
It was a camp where parents could tag along (t/n: probably like a summer camp)
We took a bus and when we arrived, I was so excited  
I got off the bus and saw all my friends holding hands with their dads
So I went looking for my dad
I ran and hugged him, but…  
It was my friend's dad
…  
We stood there awkwardly for not just 3 seconds but 5 seconds
After that, I went back to find my dad 
Thankfully, the dad I hugged was my close friend's dad
So it was a happy ending ^~^  
It was really awkward and embarrassing  
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
My friend probably doesn't know…
