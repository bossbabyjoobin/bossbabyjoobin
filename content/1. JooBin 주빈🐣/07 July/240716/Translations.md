ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🌊 The secret got revealed in the first episode

Ha

I need to improve my observation skills

I called the fairy
🌊 Fairy, sorry Bin is giving you a hard time

It's okay
That happens ㅎㅎ
🌊 Bin, do you know the tooth fairy?

🥕🥕🥕
Oh, right
I have a story
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
When I was young
To exchange my tooth for a gift from the tooth fairy
I put my tooth under the pillow and slept
But the next day, there was nothing
I found out the truth..
Too early
Later, I was playing with my cousin
And my cousin did the same thing as me
To protect my cousin's innocence
I put my favorite candy and toy coin
Under the pillow……..
🍭🪙
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Maybe
It was obvious
..ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅅㅋ
🌊 Maybe your cousin was protecting your innocence..

…? Oh..
🌊 ??: It's hard to protect unnie's innocence

………
🌊 Let's put something under Seoa's pillow later

ㅇㅋ
Seoa
Innocence
I will
Protect it
