What's the most suitable response from a WAV for this conversation?
1 Is the bed comfy? 2. Why are you sad..? 3. Oh well 4. Good night, darling
Wow, seriously
Distinguishing between T and F is clear
ㄱㄴ
Ha
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Tell me why you're sad!

It was a planned trap to catch WAV in a snare
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Okay, let's discuss why we're sad

..yes
🫧 I'm a T but..we need to know the reason to empathize or whatever, right?

Since you're a T!!!!
F is about empathizing without knowing the reason
..
🫧 Is that even possible?

….I'm sorry
🫧 Oh, I see ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ You were sad, JooBin ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ What to do ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ

………….
Thanks for the deep. sincere. empathy
Right now, I
I'm hurt again
Guess the reason
🫧 I don't know the reason but you said you were hurt, so I'm sad

…
I'm sad too..
Are you too..?
ㅜㅜㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ
Didn't guess the right answer
The correct answer is
It's not Bini
It's JooBin..
ha……..
It's okay, I'll understand ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋ
Right now
All the T's
are suffering
ㅎ허허
🫧 By the way, Bini, what's the T to F ratio for you?

ㅎㅎ But I'm somewhat of a T too
I'm said to be the most T among F's
🫧 When you stop Next, you're more T than anyone

ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Oh, but do you understand all of Next?
I just shortened it to my liking
Next

Hi, hello
It's Netju
🫧 What did Netju do today?

Today I toured from Pulipja to Safari World
🫧 What's the feeling of Pulipja?

It's kind of like
Flowers on Na Ki-unnie's clothes and
Pink flowers on Da Hyun-unnie
White flowers on Ji Yeon-unnie
In between, Pulip appears.
That kind of feeling
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I'll correct it to be a new bud
🫧 How about Safari World?

Kind of like, amidst the noise.. I was like 'oh wow' but I adapted
And with my friend
Soong
Soong Yi Won
Won Soong Yi
But when I introduced it like that at the fansign,
All the WAVs said,
It's not a monkey but an orangutan,
So why Soongi..
Right..
Soongi is a bit cuter than an orangutan
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I'm cuter than Soongi.

?
WAV trying to take Soongi's place
Soongi is cute
Took five million selfies with Soongi
🐒🐒📸📸📸📸📸
🫧 So I'm not cute?

..!
🫧 Kkyu kkyu kyakya..?

.. I'm going to sleep
🫧 There's no soul in your voice, do it again
Soulful!
🫧 Fairy, please wake up our Joo

Jup sleep
Deep sleep ^~^
Everyone
?
What, I didn't say anything
Already rejecting something
🫧 Everyone thinks it's a build-up..

I know..
(Actually, it was a build-up, what to do now, they found out)
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ Oh dear
A mistake, a mistake!
 Juju🤍🌊 Did you know?
When you see someone you love,
You don't lose memory
You fall asleep!
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
🫧 No wonder I can't sleep

?
Come out
🫧 Were we in love….? 

?
Come here
🫧 We're getting to know each other

?
Fine, I quit
🫧 I'm really cute now, are you going to sleep?

….I should sleep, yawn
Simran-dan, you're the best. ^^
🫧 Ah-ah~ Ah-ah~ Ah-ah~ Ah-ah~ Ah-ah~

Wheee~ Wheee~ Wheee~ Wheee~ Wheee~
Oh, it's not a mosquito
It's a siren
Woooooeeeeeeiiiinnnng
🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
🫧 If Bini sleeps now, a dragon will appear in her dream

Can't let that happen
Gotta defeat the dragon
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Why such a trial for me.
🫧 Imitate a dragon's sound
..
How is it?
Does it sound like a dragon?
Sorry
..
🫧 Is it fairy timing now..?
