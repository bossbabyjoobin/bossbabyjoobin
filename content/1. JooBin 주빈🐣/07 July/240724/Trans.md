귀여우어
저거 주려고 나한테 톡하고
내 방 찾아옴
그리고 또 뭐지
내가 머리 말리느라
에센스 바르고 말리는데
`언니~~~~!!! 향 좋다 향수 머 써??`
이래서 내가
이거 향수 아니고 에센스인데ㅋ
ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
이랬더니
쳇 플러팅 실패다

향수도 쓰지만
너 만날 때만 씀
 [Y/N] 만나기 전에

Konjac jelly from Japan and SeoAh's failed attempt at flirting with JooBin 

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 What were you talking about with SeoAh earlier??

Earlier, I wasn’t really paying attention
So I don’t remember it very well
ㅋㅌㄱㅌㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Oh, right 
I received konjac jelly from Japan... 🫢🤍  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So cute  
She messaged me that she’d give it to me and she came to our room 
And then what else...  
I was drying my hair
Applied hair essence and was drying it  
SeoAh said
☀Unnie~!!! It smells good, what perfume are you using??
So I said  
It's not perfume, it's hair essenceㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Then she said 
"Flirting... failed" 
ㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I do use perfume but only when I'm meeting you
Before meeting [Y/N]
chikchichik <sup>[t/n: *spraying sound* (칙칙칙)]</sup>
I really use perfume 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
You didn't know, right?  
You didn't know this!!  
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I like sweet scents
