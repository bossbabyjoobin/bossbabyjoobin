Hi  
🫧 You’re here early today!

Yeah  
So WAVs won’t fall asleep ^~^  
🫧 I heard you signed up for the kids' cafe with Toney? Binnie is a kid, right?

Oh yeah  
Do you think I’m a kid?  
?  
Really?  
Unbelievable  
🫧 If you’re not a kid, then what are you?

I’m a teenager  
🫧 So Toney is the kid…?

…..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I told Toney Unnie I’d buy her 100 cookies, but it seemed too much, so I said 50 instead.  
Just thought I’d mention it.  
🫧 Joobin, I became a fan today!!!! ☆彡

🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳  
You’ve got taste!  
![[240730_VM1.m4a]]ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie, your summer object comes out tomorrow!!

Yay  
Lucky you became a fan today🍀🍀🍀🍀  
🫧 Binnie is indeed charming

Not just charming  
Instantly charming!!  
^~^~^~^  
🫧 With a foolish charm, how lovely….

…..?  
![[240730_VM2.m4a]]Come here  
Is this a challenge?  
🏃‍♀️💨💨💨💨  
Gotta run  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Binnie runs slow, huh

..  
Who said that  
Me? ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Spoil a summer object selfie, please

No, while taking the selfie, Toney Yeonji Unnie got in the frame, so I took it spinning around.  
Not sure how it’ll turn out……  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Oh, one object, four members? That’s awesome!

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
The part spoiled in Signal  
🫧 Rumor has it Binnie got taller

Oh  
Where did that come from  
..  
Just a baseless rumor  
I need to grow more  
ㅋㅌㅅㅌㅅㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I haven’t grown yet..  
🫧 You always sleep late, so you should grow tall.

ㅇㅋ I’ll go to sleep now  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Grow to 3m so you can see WAVs far away

…..  
I don’t really want to…  
………  
It’s nice to be easily visible, huh?  
..Yeah, nice ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 If you stretch your arm on stage, you could break the lights

Before breaking the lights, I might collide with the members  
Even a small move would cause collisions  
🫧 TripleS Joobin, kicking members away with her feet, making headlines

….  
That shouldn’t make headlines..?  
🫧 Carry all 23 members on your arms

Can I refuse the request?  
……  
The stories are getting scarier  
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️  
Here’s the fairy you wished for  
🫧 Fairy, please make Binnie do aegyo, bboing bboing bboong bboong kiss

No way  
That’s beyond aegyo  
Who in the world does aegyo with bboing bboing bboong bboong kiss  
🫧 I heard you almost watched a movie with Yeonji?

No  
In TripleS, even a single word turns into a rumor.  
I just said, “Shall we?”  
And it already turned into a rumor about us giving up on watching a movie…  
🫧 We know everything

Lucky you  
🫧 Ah~ Yeonji was serious, but Joobin was joking? Why’s that?

.. Unnie, I was serious too  
Let’s see it tomorrow  
Right?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
With sincerity  
🫧 Joobin is secretly popular in TripleS
![[240730_VM3.m4a]]That’s why I texted Jiwoo Unnie last night  
Yeah  
I sent her an old meme I saved thinking of her  
Good night🤍🤍🤍  
🫧 I’m Jiwoo, and I’m so touched.

Success  
🫧 Good, Soomin is probably with Chaewon

Bingo  
That’s why it’s quiet ㅎㅎ  
🫧 I’m Toney, and I’m jealous, so I’m not going to the kids' cafe.

Didn’t I propose 50 cookies to Toney Unnie (a pledge)?  
ㅎ  
🫧 I’m a WAV, and I’m jealous too

Are you jealous? ㅎ  
🫧 Did you make them yourself?

.. I do have some conscience…  
What I made… 2 years ago…  
It tasted bitter, so I didn’t want to eat it…  
……  
I accidentally burnt it, but no one believed my excuse..  
I can cook, not bake  
You know that, right?  
I’ll watch you cook…  
🫧 Such things are usually called excuses, not explanations..

Shh  
But seriously  
I can cook a bit  
I applied for Signal  
I want to film it soon  
You’re the first Signal I’ve been this desperate for….  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Joobin cooking? 🔥👨‍🚒

..?  
What are those two emojis for  
That's totally the opposite result of mine ^~ㅕ  
🫧 It means you set my heart on fire

I like that interpretation  
🫧 Will you give what you make to WAVs by lottery?

?  
![[240730_VM4.m4a]]If you want  
Sure  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Rock-paper-scissors loser among WAVs gets to eat it

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ha  
The loser really wins the world, tasting this delicious food  
I’m jealous  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Someone turned on the AC and hid the remote  
I’m looking for the remote  
Any suggestions  
Oh  
ㅎㅎ  
The remote is in the living room? ㅎㅎㅎ  
Who could it be  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㄹㄹㄹ  
So cold  
I didn’t turn on the AC  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Maybe Soomin-chan...?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Prime suspect  
Oh right  
I practiced writing my name in Japanese today  
Asked Toney Unnie  
Followed her  
Asked Kae Unnie and Lyn Unnie  
How’s this?  
Can you read it?  
🫧 Isn’t Binnie a bit short?

I thought mine would be shorter because it’s two characters  
But it’s not that short  
I’ll look it up  
🫧 Did you write it in katakana or hiragana?

I tried both  
I can’t find it  
I can write it  
🫧 じゅびん  
Correct!!!  
🤍🤍  
Oh  
It’s a bit different from what I wrote  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 ジュビン  
Oh!!  
Found it  
Hiragana じゅびん  
Katakana ジュビン  
Yay  
Jubin?  
That’s what it said  
Jubim Jubim  
That’s what the translator says??  
Really  
Jubim- Jubim-  
That’s how they say it  
🫧 Sounds like a powerful special move

ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Jubim!!!!!!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 ジュウビーム  
(∩^o^)⊃━☆ﾟ.*･｡

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What’s this Jubim

It’s really  
Oh  
So annoying  
Feels like something Yeonji Unnie would use  
🫧 Annoying Jubim

Really feels like something Yeonji Unnie would use  
🫧 Yeonji would love hearing annoying Jubim ㅋㅋㅋ

I’m already scared  
When she calls me, she always uses a meme or something with a speech bubble saying  
Binna!  
Binna!  
Binna!  
^~^  
🫧 You can find a Yeonji version too

ㅇㅎ  
But I don’t think I’d use it often…  
It’s hard to find each time…  
🫧 Yeonji would love it if you used it

For real  
🫧 Don’t you know Yeonji’s sincerity always preparing it for you?

It’s touching..  
That’s why she doesn’t text first  
Wow, she found old messages I can’t even remember  
Yeonji Unnie: Hey  
?  
Unnie: Ho  
..  
Unnie: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So familiar I can’t even remember  
I feel like I can hear Yeonji Unnie’s voice  
🫧 That’s love

Right…??????
🫧 So when we treat Binnie like that, it's love.

It must be love~~~~~~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Today's takeaway from the From.
Jubim and YaHo

And my love
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
🫧 And 12 o'clock

I'm going to sleep soon
