Work🏢 vs School🏫 

#JooBin #주빈

🌊 JooBin noona, I don't want to go to work tomorrow, what should I do?

Well  
You've asked a really difficult question  
[VM] Going to work.. Yeah, do it
🌊Bin, going to school vs going to work

ㅎ허허허허헣허허허 [t/n: laughing sound]  
I'll give my opinion on this  
I want to go to school  
🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️  
However, when it's time to go to school  
I feel like going to work instead..  
Once it actually happens, I become unwilling to do it  
Something like that  
🌊 What about leaving school vs leaving work

Oh my 🥹🥹🥹🥹  
Happy thoughts ㅎㅎ
🌊 Lying down at home is the most comfortable [CN]

🌊 Bin did you watch Dahyun's live earlier?

Unnie imitating my sleep talking?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
Hoho
🌊 What on earth are you doing in your dreams? 🤔

I have no idea..
Spectacular
*Dream✨✨✨✨*
🌊 Do you often have specific people appear in your dreams??

I’m not sure about specific people 
But when I first moved into the HAUS
The members often appeared in my dreams
These days, I don’t remember clearly
I might be dreaming without even realizing it…

🌊 Are your dreams pretty interesting? 

I do have a dream that stands out the most
It had this dream when I was in elementary school
I was playing with my friends at school
Running around the playground
Suddenly, dark clouds gathered
The sky turned red and then a giant dragon appeared causing havoc
My friends and family ended up in an underground cell 
I was the only one in a warrior outfit 
I fought the dragon, defeated it and saved my friends and family
After that, I woke up crying
?-?
……..
🌊 I guess Binnie likes fantasy genresㅋㅋ

Probably
As far as I can remember, the night before, I watched a movie with a dragon and slept
Maybe that's why it appeared in my dreams 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㄱㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I don't remember what movie it was
