Hi
Hello
Hello
What were you doing?
🌊 Getting ready to watch the concert tomorrow, packing my fluorescent green clothes...

Heh
🌊 How do you feel just before this concert?

First of all!!
I practiced today as well
I’m really nervous and excited
I think I’ll be even more nervous right before going on stage tomorrow
I’m researching ways not to be nervous
Thank you for cheering me on 🥹🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
But actually
Even during the first concert
I was so nervous like my heart was about to explode
But when I got on stage, I was so happy and just enjoyed the moment
Just Do It stage felt like it ended in 3 seconds
🌊 Capture each and every WAVs in your eyes

I’m going to do that 😜
When I’m on stage, I can see all of you at once
🌊 Is it time to shed tears of happiness? ㅎㅎ

Tomorrow
I really won’t cry
But just in case
If you see
S18 Jubin crying
They will be tears of joy
I'm just letting you know in advance ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ 
But if I cry tomorrow
I’ll be swollen the next day so I can’t
……
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🌊 You'll cry freely on Sunday then? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
🌊 Don’t forget to take a selfie when you cry and share it here on Fromm!!!! 🫶🏻

Tear selfie 💧💧
Before that
