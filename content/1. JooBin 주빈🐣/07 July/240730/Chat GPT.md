**Let's Play**

🫧 You’re early again today!??!?!

Right, I’ve been sleeping early to grow taller, haha
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I’m busy but I’ll play with you specially

Oh, that’s fine;
🫧 JooBin, height is hereditary

No, you have to eat well and sleep well
It’s a combination of genes and habits
🫧 Why aren’t the members behind you in your object?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
That's good
I think it’s one of those selfies I took avoiding the members for sure
I like it
ㅎ
🫧 So many members are eating watermelon

Oh, I ate watermelon
But I’m not in it
Too bad
ㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
헷
🫧 You ate watermelon while taking a photo? ㅋㅋㅋ

Yeah ㅎ
🫧 I guessed right, summer selfies are taken diagonally again 😂

.. I’m trying to change my selfie angle
But it’s not easy
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It’s my fixed angle
🫧 I want to eat meat, Bin, buy it for me

Not just you
I want protein intake
I’ve been saying I want to eat meat all day
🫧 I want to eat duck meat~

?!!!!!!
We’re really in sync
I actually said I wanted duck meat with pickled radish
🫧 Insects have a lot of protein as an alternative food

I hope you eat a lot
WAVs need to be healthy!
I think it's okay if I’m less healthy!
Get very healthy!
Fighting!
🫧 Bin, eat cookies vs. eat insects

What kind of impossible balance game is this?
What are you talking about
Of course, I’ll eat cookies
No
My cookies
They’re underrated
It’s a bit ridiculous
^~^
🫧 Bin's cookies might not taste good but they look pretty, right..? If they look good, it’s fine..

The shape wasn’t good either
No, it’s okay
I definitely followed the recipe
Seriously
I didn’t measure like I did with the choco jam
I followed it honestly
Or did I
Maybe I did it my way..?
Sorry, I’ll stop
😶😶😶😶
🫧 It’s okay, don’t explain

..
Yeah! ㅎㅎ
🫧 Do everything you want (except cooking)

Awesome!
🫧 Bin, I’m eating chicken late at night, what should I do?

Don’t make me suffer
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
It must be delicious….
Is it delicious..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You’ve already washed and prepared for bed, so you won’t order it..

You!!!!
Correct-☆😉
헷
🫧 Apply some lip balm too

Pro
🫧 When the members order late-night snacks, you take a sniff and take a bite ㅋㅋ

How did you know
I smell it
Wow, amazing 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Enjoy your meal
Then I go in and decide to eat it tomorrow
`+` But I usually don’t crave it the next day and skip it
It’s an endless cycle
I’m not the only one, right?
Smelling something delicious outside
I don’t know what it is
But it’s nice
🫧 Praising you for not gaining weight

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 How can you suddenly confess and make my heart flutter

..?
Not you, it was the snack smell
[Y/N] 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
ㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Don’t brush it off

Sorry ㅎ🤍
🫧 Thanks to you, I ordered a late-night snack, thank you ㅎㅎ

Enjoy your meal on my behalf
🫧 I don’t think I’ve seen you eating late-night snacks, Bin

I stopped due to poor digestion over a long period
🫧 Bin, have you tried Dubai chocolate?

Yes
I ate it with Shinwi unnie 😮
But really
Oh
The real one is different
Actually, I haven’t tried anything else
But that taste
It was delicious
🫧 I’m curious about Dubai too

But actually
I didn’t look for it again..
But it was delicious
🫧 Is it a taste worth experiencing?

Yes
But
If it’s not in front of you
You don’t have to look for it
If it’s there, eat it
🫧 Please describe the taste

Sweet sweet sweet crunchy sweet sweet sweet crunchy sweet sweet
That’s the feeling??
🫧 Oh, I don’t get it at all

Not understanding such a perfect description..
Disappointing
🫧 .... Thanks for the unhelpful taste description 🤍

Seriously, it’s exactly like that when you eat it
No WAVs have tried it????
🫧 I think you can’t do anything related to food

No, I’m good at it
Especially a cooking king
🫧 Even if I had it, I wouldn’t tell you

So mean
Then I won’t give you a selfie either
ㅋ
ㅋ
ㅋ
ㅋ
ㅋ
ㅋ
ㅅㄱ
But actually, I don’t have one today
Just letting you know in advance
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
헷
WAVs live for the push-and-pull
**![[240731_VM2.m4a]]**
ㅋ
Love you
🫧 You only push, humph

I’ll pull
Eusha
🫧 The opposite of smile is tug ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

.. really
That’s funny! Haha
🫧 Why are you so cute when you talk

Are you two flirting?
I’ll cheer you on
🫧 ㅎ What’s your MBTI?

Have a good date
ㅎㅇㅌ
[Y/N] Two less competitors
How about that
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Love you
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
🫧 Bina, what do you get when you say “reporter” backward?

That’s not a reporter
I’m baffled by this transformed question
..
🫧 JooBin dear 🤍

What? Who are you?
k
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Besides Bini, how competitive are you, fairy?

.. Oh
I’ll ask
🧚🏻‍♀️
Get in line
Is it more than me….. huh
Why so much
This isn’t right
🫧 JooBin is prettier than the fairy

Yay, I won against the fairy
🫧 Are you jealous?

Who? Me? I don’t know such things??
🫧 Fairy, please do some aegyoㅜ

Pyo-rol-ong🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️
🫧 I’m confused, so confused...

Upgraded from disturbed
🫧 What did you eat today?

Omurice
Yum
🫧 Do you munch on your omurice too? Kkal-kal

Keol-keol.
🫧 Fairy, please tell me Bini’s weakness

Ticklish
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️✨
🫧 I’m sleepy but I need to do From with Bini so I’ll drink an energy drink

No, I’m sleepy too
Just wait a bit
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
No, even when your hand gets near
I get ticklish
🫧 Are you Bluetooth?

.. something like that
🫧 It’s flirting

..?
The new tickle-tickle flirting!
Give it a try!
Anyone can do it easily!
🫧 It seems like Hayeon would be really good at tickling Bini

Absolutely correct
Back then
I suffered from Hayeon unnie
From tickling
Really ticklish + kisses
She’d do it nonstop
So I got better at avoiding it
Before, I couldn’t avoid it and was tickled all day
🫧 That’s because your reaction is cute ㅋㅋ

.. She always had a satisfied expression
No, Hayeon unnie, secretly ask her
She doesn’t say what she wants
There’s a cheesecake on her wishlist but
I’m not sure if she really wants it
So I can’t give it
🫧 Fish is fundamentally mackerel

……..
How come all these WAVs
Have similar humor to mine?
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Fish is hairtail

Seems lower than mine
🫧 How could you say such harsh words?

? Why is that harsh?
Shim-ran-dan was really well-named
I feel it again
^~^
🫧 So you know you’re not good at jokes

..?
How did it come to this
No, before I told my dad
Dad, how can you think of such things in a second..?
And he said
You’re the same
You’re my daughter after all
….
Oh!
I found the reason ㅎㅎ
🫧 The power of genetics is strong

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
So strong it overflows..
Great
🫧 It's weird that cooking skills weren’t inherited...

It’s unfair
No, it’s genetics
My mom is good at cooking
So I’m good at it too
ㅇㅇㅇ
🫧 Unfortunately, you didn’t inherit that

..
🫧 Maybe you got your dad’s genes

….If dad’s good at it..?
🫧 You’re a mutant then..

🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You were reborn..

Like I was reborn~~~~~
No
🫧 Seeing you come at similar times every day, are you AI?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
No, it’s not that
Seoa keeps
Flirting with me
Constantly
Suddenly she smiles and says
Unnie’s eyes, nose, lips~~~~
Then
Unnie, want to go on a date with me????
It’s hard to handle
…
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It doesn’t work.
I said it ten times today
But it’s so funny and cute
I burst into laughter ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You’re not easy to win over

A difficult woman
^~^
🫧 Who’s your favorite, Bini?

Favorite
Honestly
I can’t pick a favorite in TripleS
Maybe because I spend so much time with the unnies
I can see all their different charms
So I can’t choose
🫧 I can see some of the unnies already feeling hurt

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ🫶🏻🫶🏻
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
No
All the members are
My favorite
No, really
All of them are my favorites
This is a problem
They’re all my favorites
If I could use the shadow clone technique
And have many clones
I could keep them all as my favorites
I can do it
No
…….
🫧 My favorite is you

You aimed for this
😉
🫧 Let’s decide your girlfriend and boyfriend

Hmm
Assuming the other member accepts
What’s NeNeo?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Also assuming they won’t accept

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅇㅋ
If it’s a girlfriend
I’d say Shinwi unnie
If not accepted
Hmm
Uhmm
Uhmmm
Hayeon unnie?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅎ
🫧 What’s your relationship with them?

We talked about it before
We’re just Tom and Jerry
We don’t know who’s Tom and who’s Jerry
That’s our relationship
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Wow, Bini’s Tom and Jerry

?
..Yeah
🫧 Then tell me your boyfriend

Hmm
Jiyeon unnie
Tone unnie
Lynn unnie
Jiwoo unnie
🫧 Player

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㅅㅋㅅㄱㅋㅅㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
No, it’s not like that
They take care of me
I’m grateful to all the members
That’s what it is
🫧 But if all of them reject you?

..! Totally unexpected
ㅣ
ㅔ
🫧 I’ll have to step in

?
You have to
🫧 If all 23 don’t accept you, I will

Oh, you’re good at waiting
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 If I confess first, will you accept?

I’ll think about it
If I accept easily
It’s no fun
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Master of push and pull
Challenge
^~^
🫧 What if you collapse?

I’d get up even if I collapse
Girls never die
The lyrics are really
Practical…
Every time
Ah, I might collapse
Even if I collapse, get up…..
I might give up……
But I won’t give up….
The lyrics help me reflect
Amazing….
On the last day of July 2024
We’re talking
Is it fate?!!!
Or not.
Chet
🫧 Haha, we’ll be talking on the first day of August too, right?

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅅㅋ
It feels like
A definite answer
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
A brief touching moment
🫧 Thanks to Bini, July was so happy

🥹
Hehe
🫧 Oh right.. I forgot I ordered a late-night snack.. it must be cold now……

?!! Eat quickly
🫧 It’s been a month since I started From with Bini, I think it was a great decision ㅎㅎ You always make me laugh and feel good, I look forward to every night. Did you know that? ㅎㅎ

It’s really touching when WAVs who usually tease me and only look for the fairy say such warm things
❤️
In conclusion, thank you ㅎㅎ
🫧 I hope August brings even more love for JooBin

I’ll love WAVs even more
🤍🤍🤍🤍
Today is really a heartwarming day

🫧 Hayeon doesn't say what she wants for her birthday, but she talks about seaweed soup

Okay, I'll make seaweed soup
🫧 Please recommend lunch for tomorrow

Hmm, pork over rice/meat
🫧 Ice cream recommendation

For some reason, Pabbiko
🫧 Please cheer for Joobin to pass the personal audition🥹🥹

🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
The fairy will take five more as she pleases
🫧 I hope Bin will share difficult and serious talks whenever she wants

Sure, thank you for always being by my side..🤍
