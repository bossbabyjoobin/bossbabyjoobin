`주주🤍🌊 안녕🤭 오늘 콘서트 잘 즐겼으려나~~??🫶🏻 오늘 비도 오구.. 날씨 요정으로 활약을 해보려 했지만 일기예보는 못 막았ㄷㅏ..ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
그래두 집 가는 길 안전하게 돌아갔길!!🤍🤍 내일도 아직 남아있으니까!! 더 홧팅해서 내일까지 열심히 달려볼게🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
웨이브도 조금 더 힘냉 ㅎㅎ 콘서트 못 온 웨이브도 너무 슬퍼하지 말구!! 멀리서 응원해 주고 있는 웨이브 덕분에 힘을 얻어서 오늘 무대도 끝까지 할 수 있었어~~~~~ 난 다 알고 있지롱😜😜
오늘 콘서트 응원해 준 모든 웨이브 너무 고맙고 사랑해🫶🏻 
사실 아까 한 명씩 소감 말할 때 살짝 울컥했지만 씩씩한 모습 보여주고 싶어서 조금 참았달까..? ㅎ 무대에 올라가면 항상 웨이브의 함성과 응원에 힘입어서 그 순간만큼 내가 세상에서 제일 행복한 사람이 되는 것 같아!! 정말 고맙고 또 고맙단 얘기밖에 못해서 미안할 따름이야,,🥲🥲 
말로 다 못 담을 정도로 고맙고 사랑하고 감동받았어🥹❤️ 
앞으로도 웨이브 위해, 트리플에스 위해 더 열심히 하는 빈이가 될게!! 오늘 밤두 푹 자고 내일 오는 길 조심해서 또 만나자 우리💕 사랑해 잘자~~~🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍`
