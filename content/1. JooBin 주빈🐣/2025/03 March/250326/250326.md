Hi  
!!!  
I stopped by to give you a present before going to bed
ㅎㅅㅎ  
Did you watch today’s SIGNAL?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅎㅎ I've been working hard preparing for ASSEMBLE25~
So this isn’t a recent picture
but I brought an old one instead…
^~*

Tada  
JooBin bothering JooBin  
That’s the title
I think this was from last August?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hehe
🫧 Your hair and makeup that day were so good but every pose is getting on my nerves

ㅋ  
I was aiming for that
🫧 Now it's time to sleep ^~^

Okay  
Wait, we're filming the MV but Seoul Con is already this week!!!!!!!  
That doesn’t even make sense
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯  
I wanna live that snail life..  (I wanna live that slow, snail-paced life…)
🫧 Since it’s been a while since your last concert in Korea, are you nervous??

Surprisingly…  
A lot
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It’s been so long since the North America tour
and now that it’s happening again
I’m nervous
Like really nervous
Uwaaahhh  
Phew  
But since all eight of us are doing it together, it feels a little less nerve-wracking
Like an "Alright, let’s do this!" kind of vibe!!!  
🫧 Just gotta keep telling yourself "I’m pretty, so it’s fine."

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Before I sleep, I have a menu recommendation
It’s so good  
It’s…  
It’s…  
It’ssssss!!!!  
Kimchi jjigae with Spam and rice wrapped in seaweed!!!!!!  
How does that sound?  
Sounds amazing, right??
ㅋ  
Honestly, I just really want to eat it
I’ve been craving pan-fried spam for a week  
🫧 Do you still pack your own food every day??

Yeah..  
(Packing food) For the MV (shoot) and Seoul Con..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hwaiting!  
Hehe  
I feel like my job here is done  
ㅎㅎ  
I'm going to sleep now
See you soon!!  
😚❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
Good night~
