Hii
!!!!!!  
What are you doing?
Why aren’t you sleeping?  
I’m hiding inside my tent 
Hihi
🫧 How was your day? <sup>[EN]</sup>

✌🏻Gooood <sup>[EN]</sup>
I went bowling a few days ago🎳  
But my arm kinda hurts ^~^  
I underestimated the bowling ball
… ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ
While practicing, my right arm kept hurting  
I was like _"Ah, right… I went bowling yesterday…"_
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
🫧 You should’ve started with a lighter one. You overdid it from the start...

I did, I picked the lightest one 
ㅎㅅㅎ  
🫧 What was your score? <sup>[JP]</sup>

I still managed to get 90 points
Considering it was my first time bowling since the one in US
Not bad, right?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Is it harder than in the US?

In the US, the balls were lighter which was kind of fascinating
But in Korea, they were heavier, so I was a bit thrown off  
Got used to it after that though
🫧 Since Binnie is chatting on fromm, it’s making me hungry. Should I eat tomorrow?

Yup! Have some dakgalbi
🫧 What kind?

Cheese dakgalbi 🧀🍗  
Ah right
The other day, my siblings made cookies for me  
They were better than mine...  
Even shaped like a heart… ♡ 
Not burnt… 
It's actually tasty… ㅎㅎ
So to return the favor, I made them the most delicious ramyeon ever
I didn’t eat it myself but I’m sure it was delicious ㅎㅎ
Oh and on my way to school the other day
I saw Chunshik…!!!!  <sup>[t/n: JooBin's favorite character alongside Ryan, both from Kakao Friends]</sup>
Just lying on the street ㅜ  
I was like *"What do I do…"*  
"*Should I find its owner…?* 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹"
So I just took a picture… 
ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It was so cute, I didn’t know what to do  
But I wished it luck and went on my way  
I didn’t have time
🫧 I’m sure it found its owner

Yeah probably 🥺🍀🍀🍀  
So when I got to school
A friend asked me seriously  
“What kind of pose are you even doing in the Abu Dhabi content thumbnail?”  
So I was like...  
“Uh… hammerhead shark…….”  
And I answered super awkwardly……
`[t/n: the thumbnail in question]`

🫧 Oh, do your friends monitor you too? What did they say about JooManSa? ㅋㅋㅋ

They enjoyed watching it
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ You should film a vlog with your friends like SooMin

I’m too much of an I for that…  
Plus, we have to turn in our phones, so we can’t
🫧 Just sneak in an extra phone and record. That’s more fun

…  
Too nerve-wracking, I can’t…
🫧 What about bringing an iPad? They don’t take that away, right?

True
🫧 Binnie-chan, this is sudden but before you sleep, can you recommend a song✍🏻

Okay! I’ll find one~
toxic till the end – Rosé sunbaenim
🫧 It's good！！<sup>[JP]</sup>

Hai!!
🫧 When will spring come…? It’s so cold

I know right…  
But after this week, it should be fine?  
Maybe not…
🫧 Will it be hot during the concert?

Probably not hot
More like “Oh, finally, it’s warm!”  
Wait, actually… it might be hot ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
🫧 I don’t know what to wear for that weather

Wear short sleeves and bring a cardigan or something to throw over if it gets cold
🫧 Give us a concert spoiler

We’ll dance, greet WAVs, laugh and chat ㅎㅎ
🫧 Wow, really? That’s crazy. I never imagined there would be dancing and singing at a concert

Ah… maybe that was too big of a spoiler… ㅜ
🫧 Binnie, go to sleep

Yes!   
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
WAV, I’ll do an acrostic poem since it's been a while  
Give me a word
Nothing too hard though
;;;;;;;;;;;
🫧 How about Kwak JooBin?

?  
That’s new
`[t/n: 곽주빈 - Kwak JooBin]`
>**[OG KR]**
**곽**연지언니에게 전합니다
**주**빈이랑 내일 같이 밥 먹을 생각 있나요
**빈**아 미안 이미 먹었어

"To **Kwak** YeonJi unnie"
"Do you want to eat with JooBin tomorrow?"
🫧 No

I didn’t mean for you to answer for her…  
I’ll consider WAVs' opinion then
"**Bin**-ah, sorry. I already ate"
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
That concludes today’s acrostic poem
^~^
🫧 I’m giving you 18 compliment stickers 
<sup>[t/n: Remember the star stamps when you were a kid? Something like that ^^]</sup>

Thank you ㅎㅎ  
ㅎㅎ I’m going to sleep now
Good night WAV~  
Hehe ❤️  
Love you 🤍  
Byee
