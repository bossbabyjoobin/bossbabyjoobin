Making a loud entrance!!!!!!!
Waaaaahhhh  
Hihi
🫧 Binnie, what did you do yesterday?

It’s a secret
Only WAVs can know
(Wooahh oaa uhuh wooaahh uwaa)  
Hehe  
I sent it telepathically  
You got it, right??  
🫧 Whoa, I’m jealous

Hehe  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 That’s basically a huge spoiler

Exactly. If I get in trouble, it’s WAVs’ fault
ㅜ  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
🫧 Binnie, why aren’t you sleeping? What are you doing?

I got a gift for WAVs

Bammmm

A photo taken in Orlando 
It was my first picture right before the overseas tour started!!!
🫧 Where did your chubby cheeks go…ㅠ I'm sad

…Until that exact day, it wasn’t gone
^^  
That day, manager-nim saw me and said  
“This is the most mature looking Binnie I’ve ever seen”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 (Are we sure this is really JooBin…?)

The person who used to be JooBin
✌🏻  
🫧 Binnie, do you like wearing black and white clothes?

Yup, something that’s not too flashy  
Just something simple...
I like it 
🫧 Your fashion taste is exactly like Lee JiWoo’s… You’re definitely her daughter

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
❤️  
Lately, I’ve been spending more time with JiWoo unnie and YuBin unnie
🤍🤍🤍🤍😚  
🫧 Families should stick together, right?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I heard you called JiWoo "dad"

ㅎㅎ  
Oh yeah, that time 
We were in the meeting room
talking about JiWoo unnie with YuBin unnie and some of the other members  
And YuBin unnie said "Binnie is the daughter that JiWoo and I gave birth to"
And right then, JiWoo unnie walked in so I called her “Daaaad!!!!!”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
She walked in and I just yelled “Dad!!!” out of nowhere
She must’ve been so confused…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅜ  
🫧 At this point, the three of you should film a SIGNAL together. MODHAUS, are you listening?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I should go submit an application for a SIGNAL
