🫧 Bin-ah, recommend me something for dinner please

Cheese dakgalbi
..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 You really love dakgalbi, huh?

I had it recently, so I keep recommending it
🫧 Recommend a dessert too

Strawberry cake!!!  
It just popped into my head
🎂🍰  
🫧 Is that the same one from SIGNAL with ChaeYeon?? ㅋㅋㅋ

Oh, right
Maybe because I saw that
??  
It could be (the reason why) 
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 ChaeYeon really likes you, Binnie

That date partner
We didn’t know either but we found out then  
For some reason, I had a feeling it would be ChaeYeon unnie
Feel✨✨✨✨✨✨<sup>[EN]</sup>
😉  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 You're a God of guessing. That’d be useful for exams

Unfortunately, you still have to study to do well on exams
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie… the members have already praised your photography skills so much. Now I’m starting to believe it too. Hmm 🤔

I take pictures so well that even I impress myself
Every time I take one, I’m like
"Wow" "This is amazing" "It turned out great"
I was like that  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Binnie, do you have any stories with SooMin?

Just that she’s texting me right now  
^~*  
She’s sending emoticons
🫧 How about with Sullin?

Sullin unnie ordered chicken today but she got full and told me to finish it
I had two pieces but I was full too, so I said I couldn’t eat anymore  
Then she kept saying "Eat more, eat more"
;;;;;;  
I was like "I’m full! I can’t eat!!!"
She’s went "Eat this too~~~~~ "  
I replied "I don't want to!" 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So cute  
Hehe
