JooBin’s lack of sleep these past few days because of comeback preparations

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

🫧 Binnie, anything fun happen this week?

I have a TMI
Starting from… the day before yesterday?  
I slept for 4 hours, then another 4 hours, then another 4 hours 
An endless cycle
🫧 Aren’t you tired from sleeping like that?

That’s why I slept really well yesterday  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Was there a reason you kept waking up?

I had to practice…
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What time did you wake up?  
SeoAh said she woke up at 01:30 today ㅋㅋㅋ

Oh, I woke up at 2  
🫧 If Binnie had no schedule, I feel like she'd sleep at least 10 hours minimum unless someone woke her up

No, seriously. I even planned to sleep for 12 hours  
I didn’t set an alarm and closed my eyes…  
And woke up after only 9 hours  
My body just can’t sleep for long anymore  
ㅜㅡㅜ  
I mean, 9 hours is still a lot ㅎㅎ
but I failed my 12-hour challenge  
🫧 Try again next time, let me know if you succeed

Okay~
