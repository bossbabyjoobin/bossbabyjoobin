Opera Singer JooBin: A misunderstanding caused by WAVs made JooBin stop stretching to ask Sullin directly

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

___
🫧 Sullin said JooBin has been bothering her lately. What’s going on?

?  
She’s just there when I open the door  
so I have no idea what she’s talking about  
??????  
Maybe it’s because she didn’t finish her chicken earlier ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
No, wait
I’m in the middle of stretching
I’ll ask her after I’m done
Hmph
🫧 Binnie, by the way, what’s the ratio of people who call you “JooBin” vs those who call you “Binnie”? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Hmm  
Well, first off, my mom calls me JooBin too  
I only realized it recently
I was so used to it but then I was like
“Mom, why do you only call me JooBin and leave out the last name for my siblings?”  
?  
“I’ve been calling you that since you were born”  
?  
"Oh, really?"  
That's what my mom said
I never noticed
?  
🫧 Binnie, are you good at singing opera? ㅋㅋㅋ

What kind of question is this  
?  
Sullin unnie said that?  
I’ve never even learned opera???
….??  
Pausing my stretching
I’m gonna go ask
Okay, I’m asking her right now  
Turns out it was a misunderstanding caused by WAVs
A WAV asked “Did Binnie sing opera”  
and somehow that got relayed to Sullin unnie
Who?
Who among WAVs spread this opera rumor to Sullin unnie
and interrupted my stretching
Hmph
🫧 Ask her about the “Binnie’s been bothering me” thing while you’re at it

Ah okay 
🫧 🌊 Binnie says she has no clue what you’re talking about

☃️ She totally bothered me yesterday. I was on a call and she just randomly started singing out of nowhereㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🌊 What song did she sing? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

☃️ …Opera

Huh?  
WAVs, thanks for putting in the effort to make an accurate judgment
Honestly, I don’t even remember doing that 
but I feel like it was SooMin unnie, not me
Ah wait
Not yesterday, but recently
I didn’t sing opera but I did call her like
"Sullin unnieeeeeeeeee↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️"
^~^  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 That’s probably why she thought you were good at it

? Thank you very much 
Whew 
Now that I’ve finished stretching 
I’m off to shower
The opera misunderstanding has been cleared up so my heart is at peace
^~^
