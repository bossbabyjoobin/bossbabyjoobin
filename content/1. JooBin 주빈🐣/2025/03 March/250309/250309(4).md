JooBin, loved and adored by her unnies
Is JooBin JjangChinz's daughter or KKz's daughter?

🫧 I’m curious, ChaeYeon said she doesn’t text much but does she reply to you? ㅋㅋㅋ

ChaeYeon unnie replied to me in one second last time
🥺🫶🏻😚  
ㅎㅎ So touched  
🫧 If you send me a message on fromm, I’ll reply in one second too ㅎㅎ

So so touched 🥺  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie, I’m curious, do you have a heart-fluttering story with your mom JiWoo?

During Girls Never Die promotions
she told me to eat bingsu  
I got butterflies  
🫶🏻🍧  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Then how about a story with your Dad Yubin?

Wait, this got switched up <sup>[t/n: mom/dad roles]</sup> 
YuBin unnie always hugs me whenever she sees me..
🤍🤍  
She goes “My daughter ~~~~~~ ”
and then she hugs me  
😉😉😉  
🫧 Yubin saying “My daughter” in that tone is seriously funny 
<sup>[t/n: Clip below for context]</sup>

Oh? How do you know?  
That’s spot on  
🫧 Are you still doing the "hug me" thing with Kaede and Tone?

Yup ㅎㅎㅎ😚😚  
A few days ago in the practice room  
on the day Tone unnie had a sore throat… 🥺  
The three of us sat together and stretched
Wait, sat? No, we stood up and stretched
