JooBin gets taller day by day

🫧 Binnie, but for real, you look tall. Your legs are like a meter long

ㅋ  
SooMin unnie said the same thing yesterday
She arrived at the HAUS and walked in, stood in front of the vanity and said 
"<font color="#fe82a4">🐿️ Huh? But why do you look taller?</font>"
"<font color="#b7f54c">🐣 Really? </font>"
"<font color="#fe82a4">🐿️ Our eye level changed...</font>"
"<font color="#b7f54c">🐣 Oh, you're right</font>"
But honestly, I don’t even know my height anymore
Some days, I feel tall
Other days, I’m just whatever
🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
If I sleep well, I grow 
If I don’t, I shrink a bit
That's the secret to my height ✨✨✨
🫧 Sleep well tonight and wake up three meters tall tomorrow

Challenge accepted: 3 meters tall!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
