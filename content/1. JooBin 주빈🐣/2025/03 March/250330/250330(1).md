Hiii 
How was the concert today??? 
😚😚🫨
Hehe
It’s been so long since I performed on stage 
I was super nervous…  
I was just 🤯 like this from start to finish
It’s been a while since I did a half-up ponytail with a 🎀
and now I’m wondering what to do with my hair tomorrow...
^~^
🫧 Put your bangs down

…? Maybe next time
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 How about apple hair? I don’t think you’ve ever done that

I actually did a wavy apple hair recently for the objekt shoot <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[EVER 3rd Edition]</font></sup>
but I haven’t tried it with straight hair yet
I’ll think about it
For WAVs coming tomorrow, the dress code is the same as today 
<font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[t/n: The dress code was something between sky blue and white]</sup></font>
ㅎㅎ  
Now you get why I mentioned blue and white, right?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It’s because of our outfits 🤍💙
