Comeback preparations in a nutshell — Everything was fine… until it wasn’t

🫧 Any funny moments during practice lately? ㅋㅋ

Lately??  
Hmmm  
I keep doing the *"aneukan! pogeunhan! jageun nae! ajiteu!"*  
<sup>[t/n: Come to my cozy, warm little hideout | Non scale lyrics]</sup>
Non Scale dance in front of Lynn unnie and Tone unnie <sup>[Clip below for reference ^~^]</sup>
So they’re like “She changed after coming back from America…”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Let me let WAVs in on a little secret
I couldn't help it because it was late night practice…  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
🫧 I’m curious about Binnie’s late night energy

I match SooMin unnie's energy
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
That’s terrifying, whatㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
ㅎㅎ  
Or I get super quiet… even quieter than usual…  
That time… I cried
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
It was my first late night practice  
My body was exhausted  
My eyes kept closing but I forced them open
I was staring ahead and suddenly, tears started coming out
So I went to the unnies and was like 
“Unnie!!! Tears are coming out of my eyes!!!"
"I’m keeping my eyes open 
but tears are coming out!!”  <sup>[t/n: trying to stay awake]</sup>
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It was the night before the performance shoot
We practiced until dawn, then I cried
Everything was a first for me  
🫧 Why did you go around bragging about it? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

It was just so fascinating
I was exhausted but I also found it hilarious
So I ran to the unnies like “Unnieeesss!!!”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 How did they react?

Lynn unnie was like “What should I do. My baby🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 ㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜ”  
And hugged me  
ShiOn unnie grabbed tissues and went “Huaaa… Don’t cry..ㅠ”  
HaYeon unnie was like 
“Hey!! What do we do!!! What is this!!!"  
"Don’t cry!! What do we do!!”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I can still hear their voices in my headㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But even while they were worried about me
everyone, including me, was laughing
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
“What do we doㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋ Don’t cry!!ㅜㅜㅎ”  
It was just too funny
