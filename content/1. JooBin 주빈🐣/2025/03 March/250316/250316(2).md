Binnie gets weird looks from her members for buying a bunch of bell peppers

Is there really no way to heal a tongue ulcer faster?
It hurts so much
🫧 Eh… it stings every time you eat something

Yeah, so I couldn’t dip my meat in the sauce  
Had no choice but to eat a healthy meal!!
Luckily, I’m eating bell peppers and cherry tomatoes  
So I’ll get better soon
I’ll eat some tomorrow too
Assa 
🫧 There’s a member who really likes bell peppers, right?

HyeRin unnie and…  
Who else was it…?.?.?  
Anyway, I bought some bell peppers earlier and got on the elevator,  
and everyone gave me weird looks
I was like "why… They're good…!"  
I said it timidly  
🫧 If you’re curious, just bring them near the other members and you’ll find out

ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
JiYeon unnie saw them too and said
“Wow, I’ve never prepped bell peppers in my life”  
So I told her “Unnie, today’s actually my first time too”  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ 
🫧 Is the kitchen okay?

Earlier, I washed cucumbers, bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes
Chopped them up and cleaned up afterwards
