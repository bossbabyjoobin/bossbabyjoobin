Binnie and ChaeYeon have gotten much closer since their last SIGNAL Live + Tom and Jerryz's push-and-pull antics

🫧 Who was the first member you contacted in March??

ChaeYeon unnie  
ㅎㅎ  
I contacted her earlier
🫧 ChaeYeon is chatting on fromm right now

Oh wow  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I had something to ask unnie, so I contacted her
🫧 Binnie’s love for HaYeon has faded

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
HaYeon unnie called me this morning  
to ask if I wanted to eat pizza together
but I missed her call
so she ended up ordering alone...
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 But you ate yesterday though

Must’ve been good
It was good, yeah  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 After that live with ChaeYeon, you two seem a lot closer now <sup>[SIGNAL LIVE 241031]</sup>

Yup
It’s not just business anymore...  
And we’re not awkward either...
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

HaYeon unnie is tempting me
She wants to hang out..  
I told her I’d think about it
