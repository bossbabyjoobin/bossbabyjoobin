JooBin, the girl who doesn't follow the recipes, talks about having similar taste in food with DaHyun and about JiYeon and YuBin’s unique preferences

`[For context: Binnie made Bibim for her lunch]`

🫧 But why don’t you follow the recipe properly?

..  
Because I feel like it…?  
I’ll see “one spoon of soy sauce, one spoon of sugar”
and start thinking
*"Soy sauce… that might be too salty"*  
I should only put half a spoon!  
*"Sugar… should I add a little more?"*  
I just imagine how it’ll taste in my head
🫧 What’s your success rate?

For me, it's 100% ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
If you have a similar taste to mine
you’ll find it delicious
If you’re looking for something that’s not too strong and has a healthy taste
Come on over ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Why is everyone running away?
🫧 Then which member has a similar taste to yours?

Honestly, I don’t think anyone does  
Oh, but except for healthy food  
I think my taste is pretty similar to DaHyun unnie’s
All the restaurants she recommended were really good
and when it came to foods people were divided on <sup>[t/n: Something like pineapple on pizza]</sup> 
we either both liked them or both didn’t
But I think that’s just because  
DaHyun unnie has great taste in food
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Do you and YuBin have different tastes? The one who eats pig brain…

..?  
Funny you mention that  
I actually overheard JiYeon unnie talking about it a few days ago  
She was like "YuBin and I ate pig brain together"   <sup>[t/n: She didn’t specify the dish]</sup>
And I was like "..? Brain? The brain I’m thinking of??"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
