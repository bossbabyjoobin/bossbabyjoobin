When a chick turns into a kitten

🫧 Who decided on today’s cat-ear look? Was it you, JooBinnie? 😆🐱

Yuppp!!!  
Actually, I was torn between apple hair and cat ears   
At first, I thought *"I should go for a cute makeup look to match the bright vibe of the apple hairstyle"*
but then the makeup ended up going in a slightly different direction
so I just switched to a cat concept instead
But...  
I look more like a kitten…  
My ears are so small…
^..^~  <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: tbh this looks more like a rat than a cat to me. Don't tell Binnie tho ^~^]</font></sup>
This was literally me today
🫧 Heol.. Maybe because I was sitting so far back, I just realized you had cat ears on…

..So sad
Next time, I’ll go for big cat ears
🐱
🫧 Every single gesture you did today was so cat-like. Soo cute ㅠㅠ

I was actually doing it on purpose because I was worried people wouldn’t notice
Like "Look at me!! Look at my ears!! They're cat ears!!"
From the moment I appeared in _New Look_
Yuhaengi da jinan style 🐱 <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[EN: A style that's already out of trend]</font></sup>

Heh
🫧 I was watching the livestream and I kept wondering  
"Why is she doing so many cute cat poses today?" ㅎㅎㅎ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Right
