Anyway, tomorrow is April Fools..?  
I had no idea
I only realized when I heard an April Fools Objekt was coming out
🫧 Are you secretly planning to prank someone?? ㅋㅋㅋ

I don’t like playing pranks, so I’ll just stay quiet
^~^  
April Fools… I really don’t like it
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I feel like you’re going to end up getting pranked instead

That’s exactly why I don't like it
ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 SooMin said she really wants someone to prank her

What kind of prank is she hoping for?
Maybe I should lie down in her bed and surprise her
Let’s swap beds ^~^
🫧 She would probably just lie down next to you

Ah, never mind then. I won’t do it
There was this one time
A friend told us they were transferring schools on April Fools
No one believed them
We were like “Eyyy~~ okay, sure ㅎㅎㅎㅎ”  
“Bye~~~~ ”  
And then the next day… they didn’t show up
…..?  
Did they actually transfer??  
We were all so shocked
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
WAVs, tell me something funny
I can’t say much or I might spoil something
🫧 If someone’s birthday is on April Fools, is it really their birthday?

What are you talking about?
Of course, it’s their birthday
…  
Am I missing something?

🫧 Someone ordered pizza at the concert

Ehngg?? really?  
What kind of pizza??  
Sweet potato pizza sounds good
🫧 If YeonJi and Soomin are in the same room, who do you think would come out first?

I think YeonJi unnie would be like  
“Ah, I'm thirsty. Let me get some water and come back”
