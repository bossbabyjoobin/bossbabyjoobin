WAV~~ How was your day today??
Time flew by before we even realized and just like that, tripleS Come True tour has come to an end..!! It felt both long and short at the same time… The tour went by so fast but every moment spent with WAVs made me so happy 😚

It doesn’t feel like that long ago when we first started preparing but it was actually last year!! Since we had to get everything ready in such a short time, there were a lot of things we weren’t perfect at in the beginning… But as time went on, we grew together as a team and getting to show that growth made me really happy ㅎㅎ
Since it was my first tour, I was even more nervous and scared but hearing WAVs’ cheers and support from the stage kept me going!! 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️ Thank you sooo much

Looking back now, it doesn’t seem like a big deal but at the start of the tour, I had so many worries and moments where everything felt overwhelming. But every time, thinking about WAVs helped me push through ♡ 
Thank you for being with us until the very last show and let’s keep being together from here on out ❤️
