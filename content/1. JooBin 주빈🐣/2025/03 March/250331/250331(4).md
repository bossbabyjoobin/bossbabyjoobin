🫧 I heard you used to be awkward with Naky~ Are there any unnies you’re still awkward with? <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: This was mentioned in their concert last sunday]</font></sup>

Not anymore
ㅎㅎ
Oh right, on the last day of our concert
YooYeon unnie and ChaeWon unnie came!  
ChaeWon unnie said she’d cheer for me super hard  
Like “JooBin! JooBin! JooBin!!!”  
She said she would do that  
But she didn’t 
I saw everything  
Hmph  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But she made up for it by complimenting me, so I let it slide ^~^
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Also, YooYeon unnie messaged me  
I was lying in bed when  
_Ding_ <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: Notification sound]  </font></sup>
I was so touched…  
🥹🥹🥹
She always looks out for us during every promotion  
Even during GND, she paid attention to my gestures for my part and gave me feedback  
Since it was my first time, there were a lot of things I wasn’t used to but she guided me through all of it  
I was really grateful
This was also my first tour and she complimented me afterward, saying I did great
I was so moved… 😚😚🤍
But SooMin unnie got jealous 
………  
<font color="#c3f4a5">"🐣: I mean, YooYeon unnie messaged me because of the tour??"  </font>
But SooMin unnie was like
<font color="#fe82a4">“🐿️: …Still”</font>
<font color="#c3f4a5">"🐣: …..Okay…."</font>
🫧 SooMin’s girl

Exactly…
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 ChaeWon said she got excited when JooBin mentioned her and greeted her on stage

ㅎㅎ  
So cute…  
She even came with a ribbon in her hair <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: ❌ Not on her hair but on her hood]</font></sup>
It was so adorable 🎀
🫧 Do you and ChaeWon have a chemistry name? 🐣🍓

A chemistry name for us?  
We don't have one yet
If we shoot a SIGNAL together later, we’ll come up with one then
