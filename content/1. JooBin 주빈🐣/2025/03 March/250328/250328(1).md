Finally, the Seoul Concert is tomorrow!!!!
WAVs coming tomorrow?? 
Hoohoo~  
Let’s have fun together
🫧 I’m on my way to Seoul right now for the concert!!!!!

OMG
Travel safely
!!!!
🫧 Since it’s your home ground, I feel like you’ll do even better than in Thailand and the US

.. I really need to work hard 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I mean, so much has happened between the NA tour and Seoul Con
Recording, this and that… even filming an MV  
ㅎㅎ  
So it’s been like six weeks since the North America tour ended?  
But it feels like only six days have passed 
…..🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
🫧 For me, it felt like six months… because I missed you….

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Finally seeing you (again tomorrow)
🫧 I’m going on Sunday! Any tips?

Honestly, even I don’t know any tips or anything…  
There’s too much “lalala” going on
Everything’s all mixed up
It’s basically on autoplay now
🫧 Time for Sullin Cinderella

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Before going on stage, I’ll check my shoes with Sullin unnie first…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

I’m nervous

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 If you trip on stage, just roll forward naturally ㅋㅋ

Okay
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
See you tomorrow
!!  
Sleep well  
Make sure to eat before coming
Dress warmly  
Oh, but it’s indoors  
so just bring an outer layer that will keep you warm  
Good night  
😚😚🤍🤍🤍
