Binnie makes an appearance after briefly returning from Countryside Getaway
There’s no way any WAV hasn’t seen the Countryside Getaway, right???  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I haven’t watched it yet, so give me spoilers

You haven’t seen it?!?!  <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[KR: 안봤냐 (Kaede badge war reference) | See clip below]</sup></font>
Go watch it right now  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
—Spoiler Alert—  
🫧 I swear Binnie deserves a license for finding letters
<font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[t/n: Binnie found mostly of the mission letters]</sup></font>

Right??  
Even I thought I was really good at it
I felt so proud
ㅎ  
plus I should get a license for finding ingredients too
<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: Binnie found the notes for carrot, mushroom, onion and a dud 🤣]</font></sup>
🫧 All you found were veggies

It’s like veggies run in my blood  
🫧 Even found the duds really well

That’s a talent too
ㅎㅅㅎ  
But seriously, the yakgwa was delicious <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: yakgwa = honey cookies]</font></sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
During the countryside getaway
I searched for ingredients, ran out of energy and ended up eating the yakgwa
ㅇㅅㅇ  
✨✨✨✨✨✨  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 ChaeWon said NXT's visual is Binnie ㅋㅋ

Each group’s visuals swapped
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
Kim JooBin and Joo ChaeWon  
🫧 But officially, you're NXT's visual, right? <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: her intro before was NXT's visual/maknae]</font></sup>

Thankkkkkk you so muchhhhh  
Let’s move on now  
.  
🫧 Tell us what you thought of ChaeWon’s Titanic impersonation

I haven't seen Titanic  
I was like <font color="#b7f54c">“What is this unnie even doing??”  </font>
That’s what I thought  
Even now, I still wonder what it was
I was watching it earlier and even after rewatching it, it wasn’t funny  
So I just quietly moved on  
…..  
🫧 I watched Titanic too and I had the same thought 

..Seriously, what even was that  
I think it's funny just because it's ChaeWon unnie
^~^
🫧 When you jumped for the outfit transition, I thought it’d actually change but it didn’t, so I was a little disappointed ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: was edited properly in the trailer but not in the actual EP ^~^]</font></sup>

I thought it would change too
so I was kind of disappointed as well
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ
🫧 Oh wait, was that the moment where Lynn and JiYeon burst out laughing??

Yeah  
🫧 The whole 30 minutes was just chaotic

Next episode’s gonna be the same
But how many episodes are there anyway
??  
I have no clue
🫧 Honestly, one night and two days is way too short.  
Who only gets that much time off for spring break?

True, but weirdly, we got a lot done
So it was fine…..  
On the way back after spring break
I completely passed out
ㅎㅅㅎ  
Oh right, my gift
I brought something kind of like a proof shot
<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[Text in the pic: I arrived at grandma’s house]</font></sup>

![[1745077764659.png|250]]  
Tada
I took the first photo right when I arrived at grandma’s house
The second one is after I ate and feeling sleepy while resting
🫧 Was there any member you were hoping would show up as your grandma? ㅋㅋ

I never really thought about it but if someone were to show up
I’d want DaHyun unnie to appear and sing me a lullaby
Then I’d probably fall asleep while feeling healed
😴✨✨✨✨✨  
Time for some good sleep 
^~*  
🫧 A grandma who sings suspiciously well

For real
