🫧 How am I supposed to wait until May 12? I’m getting dizzy

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hang in there~  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
We still have schedules before that 
so I think the days will go by quickly
…  
🫧 Everyone's been dropping spoilers, Binnie you too, go go  

?  
Not a chance  
ㅋ  
🫧 From now on, Binnie's facial expression, hand gesture, way of speaking and the look in your eyes could count as spoilers

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 🛌💤💭☀️🌄  
What do you think when you see this?

Who is it? They did a good job  <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: It was HyeRin's spoilers]</font></sup>
It’s a big spoiler
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 It’s literally just waking up from sleep ㅋㅋㅋ

🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️  
🫧 Would any member know right away if they saw it?

Once we make the comeback, everyone will be like “Ahhh~”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

I have no idea ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
