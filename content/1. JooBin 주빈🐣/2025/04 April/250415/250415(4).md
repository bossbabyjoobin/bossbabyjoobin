JooBin talks about what she was like as a baby and being the shortest in her family

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm
___
🫧 What was Baby Binnie like in terms of parenting difficulty?

Right??  
Well, I heard I was harder to raise than my younger siblings  
Because…  
I didn’t eat, didn’t sleep, refused to change into outdoor clothes 
and didn’t wake up in the morning  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 But how did you end up getting this tall?

No, but honestly… I’m actually on the shorter side in my family
I’m the one who grew the least
🫧 Nooo Binnie, you can still grow taller. Let’s aim for 175!

ㅠㅠ I haven’t been sleeping much lately, so I probably shrank
Confidence: lost
🫧 Were you still the shortest the last time you went home? You look tall though

Yeah, even with my UGGs on
my younger brother was still taller than me  
……  
;( I’m bitter  
He’s my younger *brother*, so I guess it makes sense he’s tall
But still  
..
🫧 You still have a younger sister left

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
There’s a big age gap
so I’m safe there… for now  
But Sullin unnie  
She got taller  
I think she’s around 170 now  
For real
