🫧 Aren’t you excited to see how the Countryside Getaway turns out…?

I seriously can’t wait to watch it
The trailer was so much fun
now I’m even more hyped
Waaahhhhhh  
🫧 HaYeon and ChaeWon were worried they might’ve ruined their image. What about you, Binnie? <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[t/n: prolly cos they did something goofy or acted too silly? ㅋㅋ]</sup> </font>

I think ChaeWon unnie has more to worry about than HaYeon unnie...
..  
Rather than worrying about stuff like that
I’m just curious about the wake-up mission…  
🫧 Who will be the winner of the less intense/competitive version of Badge War… 
(*Drum Roll*)! 🥁

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What I’m most excited for is seeing how the group that was all lovey-dovey during Countryside Getaway ends up fighting in Badge War

ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋ  
Even though there’s still quite a bit of time left (before the release)
that’s definitely something to watch out for
..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋ  
🫧 I’m looking forward to seeing Sullin start the fire

Unnie lit the fire??  
Ohhh
Even I didn’t know that  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
