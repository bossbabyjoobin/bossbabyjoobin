🫧 Oh right, Binnie!!! Can you tell us about the behind-the-scenes story of that reels with Mayu? ㅋㅋ JiWoo was in the back too ㅋㅋㅋ

So, I had told the contents team before that I really wanted to film that reels  
Then on the day of the opening ceremony, Mayu unnie just happened to be looking for someone to film with
So I was like <font color="#b7f54c">“Oh unnieee, let’s film it together!”  </font>
and we sat down to film it
I was holding the phone to record and JiWoo unnie ended up in the background
So I asked her “<font color="#b7f54c">Unnie… is it okay if you show up in the video..??”</font>  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
And JiWoo unnie responded <font color="#fff800">“Yeah sure!!”  </font>
So we filmed it
And then from the back 🫶🏻  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
She just followed along like that
Hehe
