Binnie talks about getting confused between world tour and OT24 formations and her favorite members’ parts in Black Soul Dress

🫧 Binnie, wasn’t it confusing switching from the world tour formations to the OT24 versions for _24_, _New Look_, and _GND_?

Yup, exactly
I thought I was gonna die
While rehearsing during the World Tour
I had to cover YuBin unnie’s and JiWoo unnie’s parts for _New Look_
So when it got to YuBin unnie’s part, I almost walked out  
And during JiWoo unnie’s part, I almost did the gesture…  
……..  
It's a mess
I was like <font color="#b7f54c">“Oh no, this is bad”  </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"I need to pull myself together" </font>
Thankfully, I didn’t mess up in the end
But it was rough……
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I almost stole my mom and dad’s parts
What a bad daughter
;;;;;
🫧 It was my first time seeing *Black Soul Dress* performed with all 24 members and it looked so cool

Hehe  
I really liked the intro formation
It kinda looked like we were wearing dresses or something
And I really like ChaeYeon unnie’s part in *Black Soul Dress*

I love the gesture

And JiYeon unnie’s part too ♡
