It's been a whileeee
I just made homemade tomato juice  
Isn't that amazing?
HaYeon unnie said she wanted tomato juice
so I was like "Should I make some?" and made some
But then the blender ran out of battery halfway through
so I had to charge it before continuing
and it turned out sooo good
Even though I made it myself...  
Ha... This needs to be sold..!!!!!!  
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨  
🫧 Self-praise

ㅋ  
🫧 If Binnie were to set the price, how much would it be?

Hmm
As long as the blender doesn’t give up on me, 4,500 won
🫧 That sounds delicious. How about giving a cup to WAVs coming to the opening ceremony?

Ah... I might have to stay up all night 
I’ll think about it
🫧 You'll be up there on stage blending tomato juice...

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You should start making it now if you want to finish in time

Phew... That’s a bit tough
^~^
🫧 Will you add sugar?

For health reasons,  I used allulose  
And some ice too
HaYeon unnie drank it so well that she finished it all
I feel so proud 
ㅎㅎ  
😚
🫧 Did Binnie drink some too?

I had a little taste to check the flavor
and it was perfect
😎😎😎😎😎
🫧 Sometimes, Binnie really is like the unnie

HaYeon unnie even called me "mom"  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ
🫧 HaYeon just said Binnie is our dorm mom

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Right
🫧 So does that make Jeong HaYeon, Gong YuBin’s granddaughter?

... so it turns out like that
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
And Lynn unnie made miso soup, then asked me  
"Want some?" 
so I tried it
It was good...
🫧 Japanese style?

Yup, it is
But then unnie was slicing pickled radish  
so I asked "Why are you cutting that?"  
Turns out, Japanese-style miso soup has that in it..!!!!!!  
🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨
She said they had it at the Kawakami household
So I got curious like "What would it taste like?"  
But it didn’t taste like pickled radish at all just really good radish
NXT was altogether since this afternoon  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ
🫧 So at the opening ceremony, you're giving us Lynn’s miso soup and Binnie’s tomato juice for dessert? I should come on an empty stomach

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
