Binnie talks about the Black Soul Dress performance video and her ASSEMBLE25 concept photo

🫧 Watching the Black Soul Dress performance video, it looked so cool with 24 people, even just standing there looked amazing

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Everyone was in black dresses and dancing
so it felt really grand..!!!  
But my outfit was kinda... cute
so the unnies were like "Why is Binnie so cute?"  
And honestly, when I saw it
it did feel a little different from the others…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 No, you looked cool to us

Thanksㅎㅎ  
🫧 Oh, by the way, for the concept photo, did you choose to do a ponytail yourself? I just thought it was surprising

Yeah, that's right
Actually, I got a few recommendations
and I was torn between a ponytail and straight hair 
but since I’ve already shown straight hair a lot
I thought "I’ll go with a ponytail!!" and did it  
The members were like 
"Oingg? I think it’s my first time seeing Binnie with a ponytail?!"  
🫧 I think so too

Right? Everyone kept saying that 
so I figured I should try different hairstyles little by little from now on
