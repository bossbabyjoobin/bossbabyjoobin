ㅎㅅㅎ
I’m hungryy  
What should I eat  
🫧 The answer's already decided though

How’d you know  
I'm going to eat broccoli, eggs and steamed cabbage
🥦🥚🥬  
🫧 Do you still pack your lunchbox these days? ㅋㅋ

Yup  
I packed one today and ate it for lunch earlier
🫧 Isn’t it a hassle to prep a lunchbox?

That’s why I just prepare it in advance  
So I can just grab it before leaving
That way, it’s not a hassle anymore
But packing isn’t the problem
Carrying it around is the annoying part

/\ 👜  
I have to keep going like this
ㅜㅡㅜ

Ah wait  
I’ll be back in 5 minutes  
I’ll really be quick  
Hold on  
I’m back  
ㅎ  
Just decided to go with broccoli, eggs and yogurt  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie, have you ever eaten cherry blossoms before??

? Yes..  
What do cherry blossoms even taste like..?  
🫧 Nien ate one during the Objekt shoot and said it tasted bad 🤢

Ahㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I saw her put it in her mouth  
🫧 Do you watch all the SIGNAL?

Yup  
🫧 Even the ones you’re not in?

Mostly..?  
I even watched Sullin unnie’s SecretBase   
She mentioned me there  
ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
What was it again  
She said something like I’m a fun friend to be around..?  
I was touched (by that)
