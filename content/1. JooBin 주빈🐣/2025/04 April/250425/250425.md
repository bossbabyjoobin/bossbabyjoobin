Binnie caught in the chaos caused by SooMin and Sullin in MODU HAUS late at night

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

I spent the whole day today with SooMin unnie and Sullin unnie, just the three of us
In the morning, Sullin unnie was eating mackerel  
and next to her, SooMin unnie said she’d debone it for her
So she carefully picked out all the bones 
and placed the fish on Sullin unnie’s rice
Then Sullin unnie said <font color="#7aba8e">“Thank you, ahjumma~”  </font>
and SooMin unnie was like <font color="#fe82a5">“(Say) mom. Try saying mom”  </font>
Sullin unnie replied <font color="#7aba8e">“Yes, ahjumma ~~~~~ Thank you ~~ ”  </font>
And then there’s me, just watching it all unfold
…..what is this pairing seriously
And now they're still together
They’re fighting with pillows and a hair dryer
Actually, not pillows. It's a stuffed animal
They’re throwing this giant stuffed toy at each other
then SooMin unnie waits for the right moment 
and attacks with a hair dryer
Sullin unnie screams <font color="#7aba8e">“AAAHHH!!!!”</font> and throws the plushie back to her
But they’re doing all of this super quietly 
so they don’t wake the other members
And again, I’m just watching all of this happen  
………..  
🫧 What? You get to watch that kind of show for free every day?

ㅋㅋ  
Shh  
🫧 …Shouldn’t you be stopping them or something…?

It’s fine  
Just a lover’s quarrel
Just some friendly banter
Somewhere in between
They’re literally taking pictures of each other right now 
They’re giggling together and I have no idea why
🫧 So Binnie’s just lying there all well-behaved, chatting on fromm amidst all that chaos going on?

I may look demure but I'm enjoying this more than anyone
Now they’ve moved on to a Thai battle
And now they’re battling in Korean  
Who is this battle even for…  
……  
🫧 You live in a house like that every day…?

Yup ㅎㅎ  
It’s one of those situations where
you’re sleepy but it’s funny
you’re tired but it’s fun
