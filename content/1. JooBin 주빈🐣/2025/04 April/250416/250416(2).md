<font color="#c9a3e0">🎀 Give us some spoilers about the countryside getaway</font>
<font color="#b7f54c">🐣 Ah, you want spoilers?  </font>
<font color="#c9a3e0">🎀 Mhm</font>
<font color="#b7f54c">🐣 First off, like in Badge War, there's a winner</font>
<font color="#c9a3e0">🎀 Really??  </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">🐣 I’m the winner</font>
<font color="#b7f54c">🐣 😏 (I can see the smirk on her face here)</font>
<font color="#cff3ff">☀️ Eh?  </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">🐣And then... SeoAh will probably get second place </font>
<font color="#cff3ff">☀️ Who are you?  </font><sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[EN]</font></sup>
<font color="#b7f54c">🐣 Or maybe HaYeon unnie will </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">🐣 Or JiYeon unnie... or ChaeWon unnie, Lynn unnie, ShiOn unnie, Sullin unnie...  </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">🐣 Could be anyone really  </font>
<font color="#c9a3e0">🎀 Actually, the ones who lost the game are still living in the countryside</font>
<font color="#b7f54c">🐣 Yup, only the winners made it out everyone else is still stuck there  </font>
<font color="#c9a3e0">🎀 Their commute takes like two hours every time  </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">🐣 Yeah, so if our pickup time is 10 am, it's 8 am for them over there</font>
<font color="#c9a3e0">🎀 That's right</font>
<font color="#b7f54c">🐣Must be tough for the members there</font>

🫧 It’s been a while since I’ve seen ChaeWon and JooBin together... I miss seeing you two together <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: In the KR text, it's 왹줍 (WaekJoob). **외계**인 (Alien)[ChaeWon^^] + **주빈** (JooBin) = **왹줍**]</font></sup></font>

Earlier, I made a surprise appearance on ChaeWon unnie’s fromm  
Out of nowhere, she said <font color="#c9a3e0">"Bin-ah, give us a spoiler for NXT&GLOW Spring Break"</font>
I was like <font color="#b7f54c">"Huh? Now??"</font>  
She was already recording a voice message and just showed up with no warning  
I got flustered and blurted out random stuff
;;;;
🫧 Ah so that explains why you sounded a bit distracted in the voice message

Sounds about right
🫧 I heard the members who lost the game got left behind in the countryside??

Yeeah… ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
ChaeWon unnie is SUCH an N
How did she come up with something like that so fast?
🫧 Wait… does that mean you got left behind too? Don’t tell me you did

Nope, I came in first place
So luckily, I made it to the HAUS 
ㅎㅎ
