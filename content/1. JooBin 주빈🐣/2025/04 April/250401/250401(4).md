JooBin talks about how the April Fools prank by the members came together and how she got pranked as soon as she woke up

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm
___
🫧 Binnie and ☀️SeoAh swapped and pretended to be each other  
🐱Rine and 🦆YeonJi swapped but stayed the same  
Nien -> 🥦Broccoli  
SoHyun -> 🐶Dog Pono  
DaHyun -> 🧑‍🦰Bigbo  
JiYeon -> 🍅Tomato Princess

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
tripleS who is serious about April Fools..... <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[t/n: 만우절진심플에스]</sup></font>
🫧 Tomato Princess is actually ChaeWon, JiYeon is Maximum 20 Characters…?

WAVs got tricked too  
🫧 JiYeon -> DoJoon  
Strawberry Princess -> Tomato Princess, I hate strawberries

Aha  
In our group chat, we were like  
“Is there anything fun we can do”  
“Should we swap?”  
Some people just stuck to their concepts

🫧 I knew it was April Fools but when the notification popped up, I still got confused

크크
And to top it off, I literally said yesterday that I don't like April Fools but the moment I woke up, I got pranked  
A teacher I know suddenly said they were quitting  
So I wrote this long, heartfelt message thanking them
and then they replied
“April Fools ^^”  
………  
They sent it at 7 AM, so I wasn’t thinking straight  
I really thought it was real… ㅠㅠㅠㅠ  
I even replied while still in bed
Haa..ㅠ  
🫧 Probably because of that past experience with a friend transferring…

Right…  
But I totally forgot it was April Fools  
So I fell for it and then I messaged SeoAh  
“Hey, wanna swap?” 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋ
