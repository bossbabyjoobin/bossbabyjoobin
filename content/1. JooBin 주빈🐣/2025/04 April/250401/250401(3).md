🫧 Who are you? <font color="#c3f4a5">[EN]</font>

I'm Jeong SeoAh  
Just for today, I'm SeoAh <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[KR: **오**늘만 서아 | ROM: **O**neulman SeoAh]</font></sup>
I'm Oh SeoAh <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[KR: 오서아]</font></sup>
Nice to meet you, WAV
😛😛😛😛  
🫧 SeoAh, let’s go watch baseball!

Sounds good!  
🫧 SeoAh, aren’t you going to school?

I already went...

🫧 SeoAh, can we hear your voice just once?

This is tough  
Since I’m Oh SeoAh today, my voice might sound different, so please understand
🫧 It really is SeoAh! I thought it was Binnie! Your voice must be in really bad condition ㅠㅠ You need to drink lots of water

ㅜㅜ Thank you WAV
🫧 SeoAh, has your voice gotten similar to Binnie’s because you two spend so much time together?

ㅎㅎ Since we’re always together
I guess our voices ended up sounding similar
Hihi
🫧 SeoAh, earlier Binnie said on fromm that you always come to her room and bother her. What’s up with that?

Huh?  
So basically, since I’m SeoAh now, she’s saying  
I go to unnie’s room and bother her?  
Oohh, my head hurts
I don’t know what’s going on but sure, that’s right ^~^  
🫧 SeoAh, do you still eat mackerel?

No…  
I used to but not these days  
I think…  
(?)  
🫧 Oh right, SeoAh, I heard you picked up a new impression!  
Was it Binnie? I heard you’re really good at it!
Can you show us?

Oh, that’s right. Here you go
<font color="#b7f54c">[VM: Hi WAV, It's Binnie]</font>
![[240501_JooBin_2.m4a]]  
How was it?  
크크
크크크크크크
🫧 Wow, that’s the best I’ve heard!

ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Whoa! SeoAh, that sounded just like Binnie;;

Right? Right?  
🫧 Oh, can you do Binnie’s signature “Goodnight~” in that voice?

Sure
<font color="#b7f54c">[VM: Good night ~]</font>
![[240501_JooBin_3.m4a]]  
ㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎ  
🫧 SeoAh, say “Who are you?” in that voice!!

Okay!  
<font color="#b7f54c">[VM: Who are you]</font> <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[t/n: in SeoAh's tone]</sup></font>
![[240501_JooBin_4.m4a]]  
🫧 This isn't quite the right feeling

*Sobs*
Failed!
