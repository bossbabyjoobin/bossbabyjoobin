JooBin bit off more than she could chew with her April Fools prank on WAVs

🫧 Bin-ah, it’s May. Please take a good care of me in May too

You’re starting off like this already?  
WAV actually…  
My real name isn’t JooBin…  
It’s JooBinnie…!!!!!!  
It was three syllables all along………  
You already knew?  
………Okay
🫧 Binnie, did you know it’s snowing again outside?

Daebak… It’s thundering over here
🫧 Wait, I really thought it was snowing

A WAV got fooled by another WAV
🫧 JooBin, I heard you’re officially tripleS’ chef now. Congrats!

Thanks, that one is actually true
No, seriously. It's real
Let’s end April Fools here
..  
I’m exhausted
