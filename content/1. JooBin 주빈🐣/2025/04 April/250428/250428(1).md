🫧 Then what have you been eating lately?

Today, I tried making steamed eggs
so I looked up some recipes
but they were all different,
so I just went with my gut
and it turned out super delicious  
heh
🫧 Cooking is all about instinct

For real ㅋ
🫧 Do you pack steamed eggs in your lunchbox too?

Nope, I've just been making them separately in small containers and bringing them like that
🫧 Give me the recipe..!

Sorry, I don’t really have one 
I just eyeballed it  
Just put stuff in  
Beat three eggs  
added a bit of milk
then some water, less than the milk
and microwaved it
But it ended up looking like one of those giant, fluffy steamed eggs
like the ones you get at BBQ places 
When I saw it, I was like 
"Wait, do I have a talent for making steamed eggs..?"  
I even thought of that  
😚😚😚
🫧 Ha.. Binnie, when you were cooking during spring break, you were just doing other stuff, so now I can’t even tell if you're bluffing or not

No but for real  
MODHAUS
Please listen
Once our comeback and music show promotions are over
Please let me film a Cooking SIGNAL
Too many WAVs are doubting my skills  
I have to prove myself
Please
That's all
