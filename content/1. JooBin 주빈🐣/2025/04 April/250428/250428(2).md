JooBin talks about making lunchboxes for 07z + SeoAh's legendary Mala Xiang Guo that triggered the fire alarm

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

🫧 Bin-ah, I just thought of a genius SIGNAL idea: Making lunchboxes for 07z for their college entrance exam...!!!

Heol
That’s... kind of tempting? 
Dibs on me 
🫧 Don’t the 07z get a say in this though?

That...  
Please ask them  
I’ll just go with whatever they say
ㅎㅎ
🫧 I’m curious though, what would you even put in the lunchboxes?

Right? 
I’m open to suggestions
First, I’ll ask ChaeWon unnie  
Even if it’s not for college entrance exams  
maybe for graduation or something
I’ll ask what they’d want in their lunchboxes
She said she wants Mala Xiang Guo
That's hard though…….
🫧 Isn’t that the legendary dish SeoAh almost set the house on fire with?

ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋ  
WHAT? How do you know that?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ahh, it's because of SooMin unnie
🫧 SooMin said even the HAUS next door came running too, it was chaos ㅋㅋㅋ

That's right
Meanwhile, SeoAh was completely calm
since she was the only one who knew what was going on
Everyone else was like, “What do we doㅠㅠㅠㅠ”
and SeoAh was just like ㅇㅅㅇ?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
She said 
"It's fine"
"I already opened the windows and turned on the exhaust fan"  
"I'll do it safely..."
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ
I’ll ask SooMin unnie for menu ideas too
She hurt my feelings
I’m not making one for her
I’ll just make them for the other three <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[ChaeWon, HaYeon, HyeRin]</font></sup>
SooMin unnie said 
"I want to eat mom's home-cooked food"  
"But you can’t cook"  
Like this
That really hurt my feelings
I said "No, I’m saying I’ll make it for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  
Then she goes
"Maybe rolled omelette?"  
"Beef and radish soup?"  
"Kimchi fried rice?"  
Now she suddenly has a whole list  
Hmph
🫧 It’s okay, Bin-ah. SooMin’s still gonna eat whatever you make anyway

Which is exactly why it’s even more annoying 
🫧 SooMin’s pride in her cooking these days is as high as Mount Baekdu ㅋㅋㅋ

That's ridiculous ㅌ
🫧 Ask HaYeon too

She’s in a different HAUS 
so it’s kind of a hassle to ask her <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[MOD Forest HAUS, downstairs]</font></sup>
Only ChaeWon unnie was within reach <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[Cookie HAUS, next door]</font></sup>
