I suddenly remembered something
During the Atom02 objekt shoot 
HaYeon unnie took a picture of me and sent it to me
and I was like, what’s this?  
Turns out I was posing like a weather forecaster
and she’d added a caption and sent it to me
I didn’t even realize HaYeon unnie was there at the time
When I got the message, I seriously almost died laughing  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  
I even took a screenshot
because I want to show it to WAVs once the Objekt is revealed
🫧 Bin-ah, how many episodes are there for the Countryside Getaway?

I don't know either  
Honestly, I thought it would end after two episodes  
but turns out it didn’t  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Which is actually better
🫧 When’s the next season of JooManSa starting...

JooMansa is currently asleep 
and it can only wake up once **깨어** comes out 
……
ㅜ
🫧 Has the next guest been decided??

Actually, it’s been decided  
It was decided a long time ago
Like, way back during the tour season
….
.
I picked two people
🫧 You must have so much to say especially since you’ve been observing them for so long ㅎㅎ...

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Exactly……
