JooBin drops by on fromm after a while, talks about their upcoming SIGNAL live, what she’s been up to and teases WAVs with her classic spoilers

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

*(Drum roll...)*  
I'm here!!
What are you doing? 
Long time no see
I’ve done so many things since then
ㅋ
🫧 The opening ceremony is already the day after tomorrow

But before that, there's a live tomorrow
What kind of combination is tomorrow's live ????  
🫧 Sullin's move-in SIGNAL  

OMG, you're right
Ahhhhhhh  
So that's why...  
They're celebrating GLOW members' one-year anniversaries one by one
<font color="#b7f54c">"Something about this feels really familiar" </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"What kind of combination is this?"  </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"English-speaking members..?"  </font>
That's exactly what I was thinking
🫧 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ you didn't know?

Even earlier, when the three of us were sitting and talking
we were like "What’s our combination...? English..?"  
That’s what we were wondering
So it's Sullin unnie's move-in SIGNAL  
🫧 Can you bring the four-cut you took together for tomorrows live?

Oh, I should 
I actually put them up at home
They’re not in the HAUS...
I have a decorated spot at home where I display four-cuts 
and I put it there...  
When I really like a picture, it goes there 
So it ended up there...  
*(Sigh)*
🫧 Did you at least save the video from the QR code?

I did
We were so cute ㅎㅎ
Wow, it's been exactly one year
Anything you wanna see on the live?  
I should learn some new Thai phrases
🫧 A virtual tour with WAVs where Sullin introduces famous Thai tourist spots through pictures

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
When we go to Thailand
We’re supposed to visit Sullin unnie’s cat
She said she’d invite us to her house 
Hehe
🫧 Binnie, do you like cats?

I like WAVs ^~^  
As for cats... I like calm ones 
The super energetic ones are a bit much for me
I was hanging out with Sullin unnie and taking pictures of her
when suddenly, a cat started walking towards me
<font color="#b7f54c">"Oh……"</font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"Please stop coming closer…"</font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"Stop…"</font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"Stoooppppp ㅜㅠㅜ!!!!!!"</font>
It kept following me around
so Sullin unnie had to take it away
🫧 Scared?

Yeah…  
The cat I met today…  
Its eyes were intense 
Phew
🫧 Does Binnie look like a Churu? 
<font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[t/n: 츄르 = Cat treats, Origin: 챠오츄르 | CIAO Churu, JP cat treats brand]</sup></font>

Huh?  
What does that even mean?  
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
🫧 OMG Chubin <font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: **츄**르 **Chu**ru + 주**빈** Joo**Bin** = 츄빈]</font>

What is that……
🫧 Give us just one spoiler about the Badge War teams

1TheK Pick! ㅎㅎ
🫧 We already know that

^~^ Oh, I thought you didn’t
🫧 Aren’t you sleepy? You all looked tired

I am sleepy
🫧 Is your schedule busy tomorrow?

We have prep for our opening ceremony and stuff 
And since there's a live  
I should sleep…
But before that
Dakgangjeong
Tomorrow’s menu recommendation
You think it's random?  
Just eat it.
ㅎㅎ  
I’m actually full right now 
I microwaved something too long  
and accidentally made steamed eggs
Hohoho
Well, it still tasted good 
so I’ll take that as a win
Oh, right  
I need to find a selfie with the blue and red outfits from the Objekt shoot  
I was gonna send it but forgot
I’ll bring it tomorrow
🫧 When was your April Fools Objekt taken?

I think that was the day SeoAh and I made shark bread?  <font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: SIGNAL 250115]</font>
??  
Anyway, I’m going to sleep now
I’ll bring the pictures (tomorrow)
See you on the live tomorrow~  
😚❤️❤️❤️
