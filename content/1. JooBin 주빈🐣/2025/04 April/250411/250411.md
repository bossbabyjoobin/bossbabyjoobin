I waited to give you this

🫧 Why does the ribbon on top of your head look so trivial...

That’s the whole point (of the look)
🎀  
☺️  
Heh  
🫧 Binnie feels so much more mature after the North America tour. I even noticed it in today’s live

Oing? You think so?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Guess I’ve grown
^~^  
🫧 Not just in height

No but...  
I haven't been getting enough sleep lately
so I shrank...  
For real
It’s true 
ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ  
🫧 Is it possible to shrink back down..?

Yeah, it’s the mystery of my height...  
✨✨✨✨✨🥲  
🫧 I’ll check your height at tomorrow’s opening ceremony

What if I don’t get enough sleep by then and shrink even more?

🫧 Just be confident, then you’ll actually look taller

Okay

🫧 Binnie, you looked so pretty today in your personal color

ㅎㅎ Guess I should buy more clothes in that color 
🫧 Please give us a ‘Kku Kku Kka Kka~’ voice message 🥹 You got a perfect score for today's live🙂‍↕️🥹 <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: the aegyo]</font></sup>
