JooBin bought a stress ball that ended up getting passed around among the members. Guess what happened? + Kaede and Lynn’s obsession with her cheeks

I bought a stress ball with Tone unnie and Lynn unnie  
We did a group order and they arrived today
It’s so squishy……
😚😚😚😚😚  
It really feels like all my stress melts away when I use it
But just today alone, 15 people used my stress ball
Because of that, the ball kind of… got torn  
As soon as anyone touched it, they started stretching it like crazy, trying to pull it apart
It made me a bit sad……  
Ha….ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ  
I feel sorry for not protecting youㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ
I'll let you listen to some ASMR

🫧 I think you're hitting it a bit too hard...

Well, it is a stress ball after all……  
🫧 a bit aggressive Bin are you stressed? <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[EN]</sup></font>

Maybe….. <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[EN]</sup></font>
😛  
🫧 I thought it was a yoga pressure ball

Did I hit it too much…  
Sorry, Seubol-ah…  
I came up with the name on the spot  
Seubolie! 
So cute 
<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: Origin of the name Seubolie 🤣  KR: ***스***트레스 ***볼*** | ROM: ***Seu***teureseu ***Bol***| EN: Stress ball]</font></sup>
🫧 So Seubolie also got the classic Binnie-style naming, huh?

Yup yup  
This one’s really small
Really tiny  
Like, about the size of a ping pong ball?
🫧 Smaller than Binnie’s cat ears? 🐱

It’s a bit bigger than that……  
But I’ll be with Seubolie again tomorrow  
Even if I’m not stressed  
It just makes me happy  
Like it recharges me or something  
🫧 Binnie is my stress ball (in the sense that you make me happy

You're not saying you’re gonna squish me like one, right??
🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨  
🫧 Binnie’s cheeks are totally like a stress ball ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

How’d you know!!!  
🫧 Kae said she wanted to eat Binnie’s cheeks before

It already happened yesterday  
While we were practicing 
"Yum"
She got me  
SeoYeon unnie saw it from the side and was like  
"Eww, what was that"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Then Lynn unnie pinched my cheeks too
My cheeks…  
Turns out I was a stress ball……
