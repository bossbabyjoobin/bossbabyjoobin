JooBin misses her NXT unnies 

#JooBin #주빈
___

During the Orlando concert
I think it was right after we finished our unit song?
We were backstage watching the VCR
and the units were coming up one by one in order
Then when NXT appeared
I suddenly got super emotional 
I started missing NXT unnies so much  
I mean, HaYeon unnie is here, but…  
I really missed Lynn unnie and ShiOn unnie
I kept thinking about how the four of us used to practice together, how we even cried while practicing
And as all those memories hit me, my eyes started welling up
But I had to go on stage right away
so I just wiped my tears real quick and went up
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
I really missed Lynn unnie and ShiOn unnie yesterday…  
Like, they feel kinda like my real older sisters…
Oh wow, crazy timing  
HaYeon unnie just sent me a Katalk 
She asked me to translate something and then disappeared
Usually, when this happens  
it means her next (SNS) post caption will be in English 
or she’ll send something with a pic on fromm
🫧 she's chatting on fromm right now

Of course, it had to be this
Did she send a pic?? 
🫧 She said "I’m in NY<sup>[EN]</sup>”

I knew it
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
