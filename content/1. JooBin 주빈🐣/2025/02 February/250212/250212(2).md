🫧 I'm looking forward to Binnie and ChaeYeon’s date SIGNAL

ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
When I go back to Korea, I have to film JooManSa...  
What if my MC skills got rusty?  
"Ah.. yes..?" "Next question" "Hold on a sec"
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Just make sure to get over the jet lag before filming

True ㅎㅎ  
Can’t be dozing off while filming…
🫧 Have you decided on a guest between the two candidates?

I dunnoooooo 
I think it's one of the tour members
🫧 SeoYeon, NaKy, DaHyun, Nien, HaYeon, Sullin, SeoAh haven't appeared yet except Seoyeon from the tour members

ㅋㅋㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋ  
Looking at it like this 
There’s still a long way to go…
