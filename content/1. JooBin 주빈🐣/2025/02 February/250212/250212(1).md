Binnie had a dream about the members. Was it because she missed them or was she just hungry

Oh my,  I just remembered something
I had a dream where I was in a car with the members, heading somewhere
All 24 of us were there
Anyway, along the way, about five of us including me stopped by a café 
We ordered sandwiches and drinks but I didn’t get anything
Then one of the members secretly ordered something for me
saying I must be hungry… I was so touched, so we ate together
Was it just a dream about eating because I was hungry yesterday?

I’ll just take it as a dream I had because I miss the members
