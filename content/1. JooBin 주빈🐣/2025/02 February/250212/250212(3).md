Binnie's plan to startle Sullin backfired

🫧 Binnie, did you hear any weird noises while showering?

Hmmm  
What noise?  
Last night, Sullin unnie was trying to sleep
So I… quietly
No, actually, not even quietly, I just straight up walked over  
and stood right in front of her while her eyes were closed 
She must’ve sensed someone near her and opened her eyes
and when she saw me standing there 
she got so startled she screamed
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!" 
I didn’t expect her to scream that loud
So I got flustered too  
Then we both just burst out laughing for 30 seconds straight
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 So the noise HaYeon heard was actually Sullin screaming ㅋㅋ

Ehh? What did she hear??  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Was it our screams..
