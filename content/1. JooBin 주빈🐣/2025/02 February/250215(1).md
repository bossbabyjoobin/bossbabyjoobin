JooBin, SeoAh and HaYeon had some fun on their day off

Yesterday, the three youngest tour members
 SeoAh, HaYeon unnie and I went kart racing, played VR games and tried some claw machines
Honestly, I thought I'd be back by around 4 PM
so I made up my mind and was like "I'm going out!!!"  
But then I realized...those two are E
...  
And I’m the only **I**...
We got back at 7 PM, and when I ran into Nien unnie
I was so exhausted that unnie said 
"*Gasp*... Binnie... you're the only I?"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
And at that moment, I realized 
🫧 Did you regret it a little or not?

A little or a lot? Haha
But it was fun, so no regrets
We even played bowling
In the US, the pins and the ball are smaller
I think it's called Dutch bowling or something?  <sup>[t/n: Dutch bowling = nine-pin bowling]</sup>
Anyway, I got first place in both the team match and the individual match ^~^  
Crazy, right?
I saved my energy, then in the individual match where ice cream was on the line
I went all out and got first place ㅋ  
Hehehe
Yesterday was kinda...  
I'm proud ㅎ  
It felt good ㅎㅎ
HaYeon unnie and SeoAh are gonna treat me to ice cream when we go to LA ㅋ  
Woohoo!
🫧 Binnie got first place in bowling?? Don't lie.. I'm gonna ask the members

Go ahead and ask ㅋ  
I'm feeling way too confident about this
so I'll stop talking about it now
;;;;;;  
Heh
🫧 I feel like SeoAh would be good at bowling for some reason

Well, I won but still
HaYeon unnie was the best in the practice game
SeoAh was the best in the team match
and I was the best in the individual match  
so we each won a round
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Isn’t that awesomeee~~~~~~~~
🫧 JooBin is good at sports???????????

After all the games, HaYeon unnie said  
"🦔: Binnie, surprisingly, you're the most athletic"  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
"🐣: Thanks~"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 But you can't run......

Shhhhh
