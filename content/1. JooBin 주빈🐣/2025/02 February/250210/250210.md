🫧 Is there anything you regret not bringing from Korea?

If I could, I’d bring the members with me
I really missed them today...  
I’m halfway through the tour now
*Sigh*
I miss our room the most 
Or maybe I just miss my tent?  
No, that’s not it  
I miss JiYeon unnie, SooMin unnie and Xinyu unnie
Our HAUS
❤️
🫧 You must miss SooMin playing the guitar

Wait a sec, I suddenly have a slight headache
🫧 Now that I think about it, half of MODU HAUS is on tour... They must be bored

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Exactly 
Four of us went on tour, so only three are left in the HAUS
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Our HAUS is usually the loudest  
but maybe it’s a little quieter for now...  
Nah, probably not
SooMin unnie is still there
It’s fine
🫧 See? I told you you’d miss SooMin ㅋㅋ

Having someone around and then suddenly not...  
It really hits different
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Have you contacted SooMin since the tour started?

Yeah, yesterday
She sent me a photo of the dorm 
You can see the members' long padding in it  
She asked me what time it was for me  
and if I was with Sullin unnie  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Did you get closer to any members during the tour?

Hmm
NaKy unnie?  
We’ve spent more time together on tour
so I’ve gotten more comfortable with her
