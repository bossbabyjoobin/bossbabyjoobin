JooBin talks about being part of tripleS' tall line or maybe we should call it GiantSSS?

🫧 Have you been seeing the members often these days? Who did you meet recently? ㅋㅋ

All 24 of us gathered, so I saw everyone <sup>[t/n: for lessons or practice]</sup> 
It’s been a while and wow… we really have a lot of members
^~^

Tada 
The sunset that day was so pretty 
but by the time I tried to take a picture, the sun had already set…  
A bit of a bummer
🫧 You've really gotten so tall

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Today, manager-nim said I look even taller 
As of yesterday, I’ve officially part of the tall line
🫧 180!!!!!!

?  
I haven’t reached my goal height yet, so I gotta keep growing
🫧 How many people are in tripleS’ tall line now? Eight?

I think it’s five at the moment
Xinyu unnie, Lynn unnie, JiWoo unnie, ChaeYeon unnie  
plus NEW!! JooBin  
Heh
But where does the tall line even start?
🫧 Let’s just say 170cm and up count as tall line ㅋ

I’m not even 170 myself
;;;;;;
Honestly, no idea
How about we just make tall line like… 12 people?  
That way, I can join too <~~~~~~~~~~~
