🫧 I watched the Abu Dhabi SIGNAL. I’ve thought this before but you’re seriously so good at riding amusement park rides… I’m jealous

I haven’t watched the SIGNAL yet
I gotta watch it later
🫧 Did you watch NXT & GLOW's Spring Break SIGNAL??

Yupp
NXT & Glow 
Countryside Getaway
We'll grill meat in a cauldron lid <sup>[t/n: Gamasot,  솥뚜껑]</sup>
We'll catch bugs 
Of course not me but someone else 
and pick some lettuce too
🫧 What was your one pick among the options??

That’s a secret ㅎ
🫧 SeoAh wants to do a horror-themed stuff

Tell her I absolutely don't want to 
Even if unnie dies
ㅜ
But even ChaeWon unnie is into it too
Meanwhile, I was the only one next to them going
"Nope, no way, absolutely not, never!!!" ㅜㅠㅜㅜㅝ
🫧 How about playing luck-based games to decide who sleeps indoors vs outdoors? <sup>[t/n: games like Pop-up Pirate, Crocodile Dentist]</sup>

…  
I’m gonna cry 
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲  
I’ve only ever seen that on variety shows…  
……  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 I feel like Binnie would have good luck with that somehow

Yesterday, my luck and intuition were insanely good
Feels like I used up my entire year’s worth of luck
But all I really did was win rock-paper-scissors  
and guess something right
Still, I was happy ㅎㅎ
