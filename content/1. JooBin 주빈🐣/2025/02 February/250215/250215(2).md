Sweet maknae, SeoAh

HaetKongz’s friendship is honestly something to envy, they’re like real siblings

Anyway, yesterday ㅎㅎ  
After we finished hanging out , some of the members decided to go to the mart
I was so exhausted that I gave up on going and just lay down to rest
I was just lying there like this 😶 when SeoAh suddenly called me
I was like _"Ehngg? I wonder why?"_ as I picked up
and she said "Unnie, do you need anything else besides milk?"
Earlier, before they left, I had mentioned that I wanted to drink some milk
She remembered and bought it for me... 🥹🥺🥺🥺
Sweet maknae…..
I told her "I’m okay! Just buy what you want to eat!!!"
but she said she already bought it  
and would bring it our hotel room later 🥺
Thanks to SeoAh, I got to drink some nice, cold milk
That’s the story
Sweetest maknae, really 
😚
And what’s even more touching
Some milk in US marts tastes kinda like water
but she picked one that actually tastes like real milk
I don’t know if she did it on purpose
but I was so moved…   
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
