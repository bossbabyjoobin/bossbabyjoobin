The story behind Binnie’s legendary sneezing video in Montreal

🫧 I saw the video of you sneezing ㅋㅋ

..  
No, I really tried to hold it in
I even covered my mouth 
Even blocked the mic just in case
but then I realized "Oh no, It's coming"  
And when I covered my mouth, it just made the sound even weirder
It sounded like *pururururu pubububu*
That’s how it came out
I was so embarrassed;;;;;;;  
If it had been a normal sneeze, whatever
but the fact that I tried to hold it in  
*Sigh*...
🫧 Who are you!!!

It was seriously a “Who are you” moment..
Should I just unplug the mic next time before I sneeze?
;;;;;;;;;;
