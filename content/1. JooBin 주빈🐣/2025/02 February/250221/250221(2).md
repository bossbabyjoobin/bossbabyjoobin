JooBin talks about her first day back in Korea

#JooBin #주빈

Hello, this is someone who still doesn’t know whether they’ve conquered jet lag or not
How have you been??? 😚😚😚  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I arrived safely in Korea yesterday, unpacked everything
and finished organizing my stuff  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Are you alive? 😱 <sup>[EN]</sup>

Yesss <sup>[EN]</sup>
🫧 You already finished unpacking?? Why are you so diligent?

As soon as I got to the HAUS
I did all my laundry and finished organizing everything
✨✨✨✨✨
🫧 Who was the first member you talked to after getting back to the dorm?

SooMin unnie  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
She was more excited about the jelly than seeing me when I walked in ㅎㅎ
It really left an impression
Ha...  
I mean, I did buy the jelly
but I didn’t expect her to look forward to it more than seeing me
The disappointment was real
Hmph
🫧 I heard you gave Lynn some snacks yesterday

Hehe  
I gave Lynn unnie some jelly
She bought me snacks in Japan, so we traded
I also met up with Tone unnie and gave her some
and yesterday, I gave Hot Cheetos to ChaeWon unnie
She was like "Bin-ah, I’m touched 🥺" and even took a pic 
So happy 
😛😛
Since they hadn't seen me for three weeks, they suddenly said I looked taller and were like "Why did you grow so much??" 
Lynn unnie and Tone unnie said they're scared now……
