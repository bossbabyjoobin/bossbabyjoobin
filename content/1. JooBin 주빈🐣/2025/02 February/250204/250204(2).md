JooBin struggles to handle Sullin’s antics (she’s too funny) + Sullin’s shoe mishap from JooBin’s POV

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

Right now, I'm just chilling in bed with Sullin unnie
just lying around together 
![[250204_JooBin_1.m4a]]
`[VM🎙️]`
`🐣 Sullin unnie say Hi`
`☃️ Hiii`

`[10 minutes later...]`

Ahhh seriously
I just laughed so hard because of Sullin unnie 
She was wobbling over there and the moment I looked at her, she immediately acted like nothing happened and just went “Why? ㅇㅅㅇ”  
I almost died laughing 
Unnie is so funny, for real
🫧 So Sullin is the type to have her shoes come off all the time, huh?

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ
No, so during the performance
Somewhere around the second verse, I looked over and she was only wearing one shoe
I was like "Huh? Did I just see that right?"  
Checked again, yep, one shoe just sitting there by itself  
I had to hold back my laughter while dancing
Then, after the bridge, my left shoe started slipping off
I panicked like “Oh no, please, no way not me too”  
So I just clenched my toes and kept dancing
🫧 If it came off, that would've been legendary

Then we’d be the Barefoot Duo 
After the stage ended, we came down and just kept laughing about it…
