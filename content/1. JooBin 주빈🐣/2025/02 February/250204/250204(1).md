Even the contents team was shocked when SeoAh did that

🫧 I love the Reels Binnie filmed with SeoAh

Haha 
Oh, about that 
The behind-the-scenes story was when I sent it to the contents team
they got back to us like
"Was SeoAh kicking at the end a mistake or intentional..?"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So I told them it was on purpose...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Did your phone break?

Not my phone ㅎ  
But thankfully, it was fine 
At first, I was like "Huh..? Eh..?"  
But after she kicked it about three times
I just got used to it and thought  
"Okay, I'll just strike a pose next to you"  
I just did a peace sign ✌🏻  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 America changed SeoAh 😅 <sup>[EN]</sup>

Think so too..  <sup>[EN]</sup>
HaYeon unnie saw SeoAh and said she looked like an American kid
And I totally got what she meant which made it even more annoying..
