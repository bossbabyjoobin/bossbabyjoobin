Hi WAV!!🍀  
In the blink of an eye, our North American tour has come to an end and now only the Seoul concert is left. I still can't believe we've already completed nine shows, from Bangkok to the US and Canada.. At first, I thought *"It's going to be a long tour, so I need to brace myself!!"* But after giving my all on every stage and meeting so many WAVs, time flew by so fast🥺 It’s such a shame but they say time passes even quicker when you’re doing something you love.. I think that’s really true ㅋㅋㅋㅋ I want to come back again and make even more amazing memories with more WAVs

Whether it felt short or long, I was able to meet new WAVs and share precious moments. This tour was especially meaningful because I fulfilled one of my wishes, communicating with WAVs in English and was able to meet so many international WAVs!! Getting to experience a moment I’ve always dreamed of together with WAVs made me even happier😚😚 Thanks to our WAVs, every single day was truly joyful and filled with happiness. I'm so grateful

Since this was my first tour, I was really nervous and had a lot of worries but thanks to WAVs’ support, both from afar and up close, I gained strength and grew so much!! I’ll keep growing more and more, so stay with me till the end, WAV♡ Thank you for making this time so unforgettable and meaningful for me and I love you so so much🫶🏻🤍

It’s past 2 AM here and before going to sleep, I wanted to share my thoughts about this tour. I wrote everything in a rush, so it might sound a little messy but I hope you understand ㅎㅅㅎ I love you so so much WAVVVV❤️ I'm going to sleep now, good night😴✨
