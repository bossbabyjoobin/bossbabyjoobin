JooBin’s thoughts halfway through the tour

WAVs, what did you eat for lunch?  
It’s 4 PM in Korea now, right?
For dinner, I recommend kimchi fried rice
Not because I want to eat it or anything  
I just think it’d be really good, so I’m recommending it  
The first thing I’m eating when I get back to Korea is kimchi fried rice ㅜ
Can’t believe we’re already halfway through  
There's one thing I've realized now that half of the world tour stops are done
Meeting WAVs is seriously the best  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
On stage, hearing WAVs’ cheers through my IEM gives me so much strength and makes me happy every single time I perform
😚😚😚😚
🫧 Do you have a favorite stage?

Hmmm, right now? 
I’d say Cherry Talk 
I’d been wanting to perform it for a while
so finally getting to do it on tour felt really nice
