🫧 What did you eat today?? ㅠㅠ Hope you had lots of good food

I had the most delicious and fun meal since coming to the US today  
Had steak  
Went full cowboy mode
Then had dessert
You'll understand when you see it
Cowboy hat.. bandana.. the combination of the two
Finished my steak and was waiting for dessert
but instead of dessert, they suddenly brought out hats and bandanas
I was like "? What is this"
Then all of a sudden "For you guys~~~~~~ <sup>[EN]</sup>"
One by one, they put cowboy hats on our heads 
and tied bandanas around our necks
I just said "Oh.. wow..! Thank you..! <sup>[EN]</sup>"
At that point, we were all just confused like... what is happening?
But in the end, we all just went with it, had fun, took pics and laughed
They told us to keep the bandanas
So I did……….  
It’s in my bag……..
