Two sides of Binnie: the Eldest and the Maknae

🫧 Binnie needs to sleep at least 9 hours a day. Beauties need their beauty sleep

I sleep too much, that’s the problem
If there’s no alarm, I can sleep for half a day
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
🫧 But Binnie, didn’t you say you don’t wake up to alarms?

You can’t just bring up something from a year ago now
I wasn’t expecting to wake up to someone else’s alarm
I think it's better not to hear it
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 If I don't hear it, it causes trouble for others, so I think it's better to hear the alarm even if I'm tired

That's why I always caused trouble for my siblings...
When they came to wake me up
I’d be like "Uhh.. I’ll get up in an hour"  
Then an hour later, I'd just go back to sleep
🫧 I want to see you telling your siblings to turn off the lights

I actually ask them to bring me water
As for the lights...
Luckily, I had a remote
so I'd just set a timer and go to sleep
But when it was time to eat
I’d be like "Hey hey hey hey hey hey"
"Hurry hurry hurry"
"Just one glass of cold water ㅎㅎ 🥺"  
And they'd scurry over to bring it to me
But once they got older, they’d be like "Noona, you go get it yourself"  
And I was completely taken aback  
🫧 So you only made your younger brother do it? ㅋㅋㅋ
<sup>[t/n: I think it's because her younger brother is the second eldest, their youngest is a girl]</sup>

Yup ㅎㅎ 
🫧 If my younger sibling asked, I’d do it for them

You're a kind sibling then...
🫧 What if HaYeon or Lynn asked you to get them a glass of water?

If they said "Go get some water!!"  
I’d probably go "?? I don't want to"  
But if they asked "Can you get me some water?" <sup>[Politely]</sup>  
I’d be like "Okayy"  
You know "If you ask nicely, the water comes your way"

`[t/n: She's referring to a korean proverb here "가는 말이 고와야 오는 말이 곱다" but twisting it to fit the context of asking for water. A similar English proverb would be "Kind words cost nothing but mean everything" making it easier to understand ^~^]`
