Binnie's dilemma over her chubby cheeks and WAVs' and her members' opinions 

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

___
🫧 Binnie, your chubby cheeks are gone. Stop working out ㅠㅠ 
<sup>[t/n: Binnie has been working out even before the tour and has continued to this day]</sup>

…………  
You don’t have to worry at all
I still have a very  
extremely  
huge amount
Haaa…. (*Sigh*) 
ㅜ
🫧 But they're cuteㅜㅜ

Even when I try to lose them
They won’t go away ㅎㅎ
I told the unnies yesterday and they were like,
"That’s what makes you cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  
Hearing that was so sweet  
It really touched me..  
🥺  
ㅠ
🫧 Binnie, if I ever get the chance to meet you, can I grab and stretch your cheeks? 크크

If WAV becomes (a member of) tripleS  
I’ll let you do it
^~^  
It’s not that easy, you know  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Ask HaYeon to grab and stretch your cheeks for me

Don’t worry, she’ll do it even if you don’t ask
🫧 Who touches Bin’s cheeks the most?

Most recently, as of yesterday
It was Lynn unnie  
I think she squished my cheeks about a million and twenty-five times
I quickly sucked my cheeks in
<sup>[t/n: To avoid Lynn squishing her cheeks, imagine drinking from a straw –  that’s what she did]</sup>
But then unnie went "Aaaaah nooooooo! My cheeeeeeeeeks"  
And I was like "They’re my cheeks tho" 
;;;;;;;;;;;  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋ
🫧 Which side is softer?

I think I said this before
but as of now, the left side
