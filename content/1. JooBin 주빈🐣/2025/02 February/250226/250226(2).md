Sullin's unexpected message early in the morning

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

This morning
I woke up to a message from Sullin unnie
I was like *"Huh? What's this?"* and checked it 
There was a picture
The moment I tapped on it
I saw a picture of my leg sticking out of the tent while I was still asleep 
Technically, it was my foot
She sent a tickling emoticon and said that
when she woke up, stretched, and yawned
she looked down and just saw my foot there
She found it so funny that she took a picture and sent it to me
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
