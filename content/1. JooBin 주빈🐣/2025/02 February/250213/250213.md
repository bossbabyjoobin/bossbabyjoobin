The story of how Binnie was scouted by MODHAUS or should I say, the story of how we almost lost IDOL JooBin to life as a full-time student

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

🫧 Tell us about how you joined MODHAUS please

ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I’ve never talked about this before, right?
It’s a secret ㅋ
The story of how I joined MODHAUS…  
Starts now
Wait, when was it again?  
I don’t remember what grade I was in but it was 2023
It was the beginning of summer break, right after finals  
To celebrate, my friends and I planned to go to an amusement park
decided to go to an amusement park to celebrate the end of exams
But I wasn’t really counting down the days or anything
To be honest, I felt super lazy that morning and seriously considered bailing
I was lying there thinking *“Should I just tell them we’ll meet next time?”* 
while texting “Hey guys, are you all getting ready?”  
But in my head, I was like “Should we just push it back?”
Then my friends basically dragged me out
So I ended up going and we got in line for the Gyro Drop <sup>[t/n: Lotte World]</sup>  
I think we rode it like 10 times in a row that day
Anyway, while waiting in line 
I noticed two women standing near the exit
We kept making eye contact, so my friends and I were like  
“Huh? Maybe they’re going to ask for directions?”
So we got on the ride, got off and I was fixing my hair with a brush 
Not in a graceful way but more like vigorously 
And suddenly, they started walking toward us
I thought *"Oh, they really are gonna ask for directions"*
I even said (to my friends) 
“I’m bad with directions. Do you guys know the way?”
But just as they reached us, they said
“Hey ~~~ can we talk to you for a moment?”
I got scared and was like “Huh? Uh… okay…”
and just followed them without thinking  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ
Before I left, my friends were like 
“Be careful" "This is really dangerous. Get yourself together" "Don’t go”  
But I couldn't hear anything since I was scared and just went
Then they asked “How old are you?”  
And my automatic response was “I was born in 2009…!”
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I mean, who just tells strangers their age?  
But I blurted it out without thinking
They asked my name and other things  
then handed me a business card  
They also asked if I knew a group called tripleS
I also watch broadcasts <sup>[t/n: probably music shows]</sup>
and listened to _Generation_ and _Rising_ so I knew about tripleS 
So I was like “Oh! Yes!!”  
And next thing I knew  
I was part of NXT
ㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Wow, that story is insane. Now I get why you let it sit for a year before telling us

Right??  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 What did your friends say? ㅋㅋ

After getting the business card, I went back to my friends and they were like 
“What did they say?" "Were they asking for directions?" "Are you okay?”
And I just said “Uh… yeah…”
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
If it weren’t for those friends
I’d probably be studying right now
^~^
🫧 JooBin's friends, thank you~

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 How did your family react?

To be honest, I had never even considered this path before
My parents told me to try it if I wanted to  
So I decided to give it a shot during the break
But when school started, balancing everything got tough
So I was planning to quit but they told me 
“Just wait a little longer” 
So I waited ^~^
Then one day, I got a message “Come to this place at this time”
I replied “Yes, got it”  
And when I arrived
Ta-da! There I was, in front of a camera
I was waiting there in silence and then…
ShiOn unnie appeared!  
Lynn unnie appeared!  
HaYeon unnie appeared!
I was like “What is happening??”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It was so surreal
🫧 Members’ stories about joining the company are always fun  ㅋㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Was your teaser the hand one?

Yeah ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Do your younger siblings know tripleS?

Yeah, my sibling loves Non Scale 
They sing it all the time
🫧 Had you never sung before? Or danced?

I danced but when I had to sing
I happened to have the flu  
so my voice was completely gone…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I greeted them like “Hello… *(cough)*”  
I was like “I have a flu, so my voice…”  
Ugh
They asked me to sing one line  
but my voice literally wouldn’t come out
I sang one line and my throat just gave up  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 But somehow, you still ended up with us

Heh
It was fate 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
