🫧 World Tour Gravity was announced today but Binnie’s not in it...
<sub>[오늘 월드투어 그래비티 떴더라 근데 빈이가 **없네**...]</sub>

I've got no umbrella... <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[t/n: 우산이 **없네** | Door lyrics]</sup></font>
Binnie's not there… <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[빈이가 **없네**]</font></sup>
I really want to meet our international WAVs too  
But since I already went on tour last time…
Ah…
Preparing for the tour was really hard
but looking back, it became a precious memory
When I meet WAVs later on, I get to say
"Remember when we met back then~~ " and stuff like that
I got closer with the members  
My roommate changed too, so it felt like a new experience  
I got to eat breakfast ㅎㅎ <sup><font color="#c3f4a5"> [t/n: Binnie usually skips breakfast and eats brunch instead]</font></sup>
and try local food too ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Anyway, it was seriously great  
So I do want to go again
But I hope the new members going on tour this time  
get to enjoy it as much as I did..
😘

<font color="#b7f54c">[VM: No but there's something even sadder than that. NXT unnies are going (on tour) except for me. I mean A (Unit) unnies, B (Unit) unnies are all going but they're going on a tour without me. So sad. Looks like we'll be apart again for a long time]</font>

<sub><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: She’s pointing out that even A and B unit members get to go, so why not her too? ㅋㅋ]</font></sub>

🫧 How could they leave out just Binnie from NXT… That's so sad ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

Haa.. I’m sad  
🫧 Just keep calling until they’re too tired to even pick up

What if I get blocked for interfering with the tour

<font color="#b7f54c">[VM: It's okay ~ I'll just ask them to buy me something delicious]</font>
🫧 NXT unnies are gonna be like “Binnie look at this” and send you hundreds of food pics, can you handle that??

Heol
I’m gonna fight back  
with last year’s tour pics!!!!  <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: I think she forgot that it's just this year ^~^]</font></sup>
