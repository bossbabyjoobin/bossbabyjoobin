Everyone
I’ve got some amazing news
Tent recruit: success!
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
I’ve successfully recruited another unnie
It’s none other than...
JiYeon unnie
Now in our room, it’s like a perfect mirror image
When you walk in, you’ll be greeted by two tents

Hihi
🫧 Are you a tent ambassador?

Yup
I think I might be  
I even helped her set it up
🫧 So JiYeon couldn’t handle SooMin either huh? 
<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: This is a joke. Turns out the tent helps block SooMin’s “power talking” ^~^]</font></sup>

Yeah...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Our room has basically become a room within a room...
Together but also separate..
Community and individuality..
That’s what our room is now
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It’s fun
