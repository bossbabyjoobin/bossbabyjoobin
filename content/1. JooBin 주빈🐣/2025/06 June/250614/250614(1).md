Ah seriously ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ  
I don’t need a dorm upgrade…  
It just made me so sad 
Watching it again…  
I felt really sorry
Even though I know I have nothing to be sorry about
It’s just…  
She's just a baby
And with it being between the maknaes 
Doing something like that was just too cruel  
I got sad watching it ㅠㅠ  
🫧 I finally understood why there was no answer when I asked whether you slept on the floor or the bed ㅎㅎ

Right? But then there was that huge plot twist
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜ  
But after everything changed like that  
Neither SeoAh nor I got our luggageㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ  
I’m starting to think maybe the switch-up wasn’t the best idea…  
SeoAh’s Toto wasn’t in my room either  
I think it ended up somewhere else…  
ㅠㅠㅠㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠ
And honestly, I didn’t know how Russian Roulette worked  
so I thought we were supposed to shoot each other  
and I was like <font color="#b7f54c">“You want me to shoot this…?? ㅠㅠㅠ!?ㅠ!?!!??”  </font>
And for like 30 seconds, I just stood there all confused after being told to go first like <font color="#b7f54c">“This… how am I supposed to do this? This isn’t right…”</font>  
And then SeoAh said <font color="#cff3ff">“Shoot it, unnie”</font>  
And I was like <font color="#b7f54c">“Nooooo ㅠㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜ”</font>  
Turns out you’re supposed to shoot it above your own head 
;;;;;;;;;;  
I almost messed up and shot the flour bomb at someone else…  
I almost became a terrible person… ㅜ  
Phew
🫧 You really didn’t know the rules for Russian Roulette???

Yup…  
I heard it came from that shooting game thing  
so I thought<font color="#b7f54c"> "you shoot each other??"</font>  
<font color="#b7f54c">"Wow that's so cruelㅠㅜㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜ"  </font>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Guess not ㅎㅎ  
But I thought the winner would get a badge... 
Hmph  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But WAV, a game is just a game…  
Of course back then, it was cold and we were exhausted so it was tough
but watching it now, we’re all just laughing about itㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
In our group chat, everyone’s talking about how funny their own faces looked  
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ
This is reality show  
`<<<ENTERTAINMENT SHOW>>>`  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
ENTERTAINMENT!!!!!!!!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Like NaKyoung said too, it’s so intense that even we get worried while watching sometimes 🥹🥹🥹

ㅠㅠ Right??  
But the editing was so well done…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Don’t worry WAV~  
Seeing how everyone’s fine now  
It’s all okay~~~~~~~  
Everyone was super competitive 
But we got through it safely and we all did great
So don’t worry  
😚  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
