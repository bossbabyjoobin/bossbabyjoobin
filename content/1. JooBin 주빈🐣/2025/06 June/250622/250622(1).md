Wanna say hi?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
This morning, I woke up all my roommates
The early bird wakes the roommates  
Kkaak Kkaak <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: 까악까악 Crow sound]</font></sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ
🫧 Did you wake them up using non-violent methods?

What are you thinking…  
Of course I did  
I was like <font color="#b7f54c">“JiYeon unnie… there’s 20 minutes left" </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"If you’re going to get ready, get up~”  </font>
And I woke Sullin unnie up 10 minutes before  
Because she always sleeps a bit longer before getting ready 
<font color="#b7f54c">“Sullin unnie!! 10 minutes left!!”  </font>
That’s how I woke her up  
🫧 So you're basically a human alarm clock? Does Binnie always wake everyone up?

It’s different every time  
If someone can’t wake up, we just wake each other  
But I sleep in a tent  
So they probably get confused about whether I’m even in the room or not  
🫧 Wait, do you sleep in a tent at home too??

Nope, at home I just sleep normally  
But I do tell my younger siblings to be quiet  
It doesn’t work but I try to scare them  
<font color="#b7f54c">"Ahhhh!!! If you don’t stay quiet…"  </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"Unnie’s going back to the HAUS!!"  </font>
Then she goes “Nooo unnie, don’t go”  
And I’m like <font color="#b7f54c">“…Well, I can’t go right now anyway…”  </font>
Then it gets noisy again  
"Unnie, so at school I…" this that  
And if I fall asleep  
Then my sibling goes “Unnie? Unnie?”  
Gives up and goes to sleep
Pro tip: pretend to be asleep  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 So you’ve actually pretended to be asleep before?

;;;;;;;Correct  
🫧 So SooMin at the dorm and your sibling at home… that must be tough

Ah, so it’s basically the same thing?
