🫧 Bin I was so emotional on the last episode of badge war, I had a feeling jiyeon was going to win. Next time Bin going to be badge war number one. <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[EN] </font></sup>

Yess the next winner is me😚<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[EN] </font></sup>
When the Badge War episode came out
I watched it while showering after the fansign  
JiYeon unnie won and when she unlocked the chest  
I suddenly got so emotional 
While shampooing, I cried with her  
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
So I ended up crying in the showerㅠ  
I wanted to tell JiYeon unnie about it but I got embarrassed
I didn’t want to be *that kid who cried while shampooing*
So I ended up telling her the next day at the fansign
<font color="#b7f54c">“Unnie, actually… I cried again watching it yesterday”  </font>
Even back then, when JiYeon unnie won, I cried with her
It was just so moving
I don’t even know what exactly moved me but you know what I mean  
🫧 Binnie, you cried with her back then and now again watching it because you just empathize with her

Right? There's a narrative behind it  
That girl is a ballerina. <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: It's exactly what you think it is ^~^]</font></sup>
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ  
I had a gut feeling  
I just knew JiYeon unnie was going to win  
ㅋ  
And she really did
(What happened is) so moving/touching  
I’m so moved

Ha.. really  
The hidden badge… What a shame  
🫧 You got one though

I shouldn’t have told them to clean up the trash  
ㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
There’s actually a behind-the-scenes story to that  
Since it was a hidden badge mission
The managers didn’t say anything about the trash
They were all pretending not to notice
But then I said <font color="#b7f54c">“Please take your trash with you” </font> 
And they were like “No Binnie, you said it”  
And I was like “Huh? No way, must’ve been someone else, right?”  
They said “Nope, it was definitely you”  
“…? Huh?”  
Then I watched the video yesterday  
And yeah… it was me  
………………  
If I had just kept quiet, I would’ve been the only one who got it
ㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ha... 
The winner next season will be me
Judging by the fact I sensed the hidden badge 
So it’s gotta be me  
But if there’s no next season…  
That’d be a shame
*(Crying sound)*
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
