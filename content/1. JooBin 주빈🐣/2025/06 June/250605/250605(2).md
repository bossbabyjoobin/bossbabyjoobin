Another piece of lore behind JooBin's name

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm
___

🫧 But why does Lynn go with “Lynn” instead of “Rin” like how it’s usually spelled in Japanese?

Well, she does use “Rin"
but she asked me if there were any other versions
So I told her “Lynn” is another common one
There are actually a lot of cases where the name the company uses is different from what the person themselves actually uses
Like me
It's not “Bin”, it's “Been”  
Not “Bean”  
Joo Been  
Now it feels awkward;;;;
But since YuBin unnie goes by “YuBin”  
I figured mine would probably become “JooBin” too
