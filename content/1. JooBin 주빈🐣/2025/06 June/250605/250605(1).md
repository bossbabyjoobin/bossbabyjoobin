JooBin played a big role in creating Lynn and ShiOn’s signatures and talked about how her own signature came to fruition

I'm here
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I just got back from signingㅠ <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[autographs]</font></sup>
Hehe  
🫧 Tell us the behind-the-scenes of how you made your signature

Ah right 
Since NXT's music was coming out
we were working on our autographs and each made two or three versions
But I didn’t have one yet, so I had to start completely from scratch
While thinking about it, since I’m Joobin,  I really wanted it to reflect that
So I based it around “bin” and added hearts
That’s how my current signature was born

I remember having another one too but I didn’t really like it
I was like “Ehh, it’s kinda meh?” but I submitted it just in case 
Turned out, my idea matched with the CEO’s ^~^
So we went with this one
I also helped a lot with Lynn unnie and ShiOn unnie’s signatures hehe
ㅎㅎ
For ShiOn unnie, since she's NXT's main vocal 
I said <font color="#b7f54c">“Unnie, what about something like a music note?” </font> 
<font color="#b7f54c">"Like a treble clef"  </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"Like this, we turn it into kind of an S shape"</font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"then add “ㅣ온” at the end" </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">“hion”</font> <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[EN]</font></sup>
It was just a scribble
The version that unnie got used to writing is the the one she uses now 
ㅎㅎ

And for Lynn unnie  
She asked me “What’s "린" in English?”  
I said “Lynn! I think adding a heart would look cute”  
So I gave her the idea and she made it her own
Tada! That’s how Lynn unnie’s signature was born too

🫧 Seems like only HaYeon came up with hers on her own?

HaYeon unnie already had a signature, so she just used that one
But when I looked at it, I asked
<font color="#b7f54c">“Unnie, what is this..?”  </font>
<font color="#53d9bc">“It’s wings🪽”   </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">“? Where…?”  </font>
<font color="#53d9bc">“Look at this, these are the wings” </font> 
<font color="#b7f54c">"Oh……………" </font>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 I totally didn’t get it  

Me neither ㅎㅎ
🫧 Binnie, you seem pretty good with your hands, from signing to decorating top loaders and even cooking <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: ShiOn’s signature was honestly a genius idea ngl]</font></sup>

Of course! Trust me ^~^
