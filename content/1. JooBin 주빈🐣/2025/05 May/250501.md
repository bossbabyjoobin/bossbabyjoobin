Sulbingz in a Nutshell
Just another normal day at MODU HAUS
 
#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

Sullin unnie shook my tent
and I screamed like  
<font color="#b7f54c">“"UwaaAAaahghghghAAaaaaaGGHHH"</font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"Earthquake Earthquake!!!!!!"</font> <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[EN]</font></sup>
Then she just laughed and left
🫧 Was SooMin not there?

She's right next to me, she just sang a verse from a song
She hadn’t seen the teaser yet
so I explained it to her
Like “Oh, it was like this and this person showed up" 
"this scene we filmed was in it too"
"and apparently it’s the Care version, so maybe there’s more?"
I explained everything one by one
🫧 There’s seriously never a quiet day in that room

Not just our room, it's the whole HAUS
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
