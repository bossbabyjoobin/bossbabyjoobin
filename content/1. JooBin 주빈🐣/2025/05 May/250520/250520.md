Waaahhhhhh  
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  
Thank you so much for giving us 1st place on The Show.. 🥲🥹🥹❤️  
Even if we hadn’t won today, just hearing WAVs' cheers and your loud voices already moved me so much  
But then, to actually win 1st place too… 🥹😚😚😚😚  
It really feels true that we’re able to shine thanks to WAVs
❤️❤️❤️  
We’re already preparing for tomorrow’s music show, but I’m still so happy
Even if I don’t get to sleep, the moment I see WAVs and step on stage
that moment alone makes me truly happy
Once again, I felt just how precious all of this is
I'm always thankful for everything
I might sound a bit all over the place since I’m a bit tired right now.. ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ 
But still, I really do mean every word I said ❤️
It’s been a year since we stood in the same place and received this award...
It brought back a feeling that’s hard to put into words
Time feels like it flew by
but in that short… long… time to have come this far together with WAVs
It’s just amazing and I’m so thankful for that
