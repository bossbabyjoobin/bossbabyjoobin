🫧 I missed Binnie so much, I was crying while debating whether or not to eat buldak ㅠㅠ

Did you end up eating it?!ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ  
I want to eat kimchi fried rice topped with lots of cheese and cream
I was talking to SeoYeon unnie during practice earlier  
and I told her <font color="#b7f54c">"Unnie, I wanna eat kimchi fried rice ㅠㅠㅠㅠ"  </font>
And she replied<font color="#1e90ff"> “Should I make it for you?”  </font>
And just like that, my heart fluttered  
😍😍😍😍  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Without a second of hesitation
<font color="#b7f54c">“Yes!”  </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">“I’d love that!”  </font>
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ
I want to eat food like
Tuna kimbap  
Kimchi fried rice  
That kind of food
🫧 Those are actually the two dishes I’m good at making but I can’t make them for youㅜ I’ll eat them for you insteadㅜㅜㅜㅜ

Make it for me
hahahahehehe  
🫧 is the SeoYeon you mentioned Ji SeoYeon or Yoon SeoYeon?

Yooon <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[EN]</font></sup>
SeoYeon unnie  
But I also mentioned it to JiYeon unnie too
I told her <font color="#b7f54c">“Unnie, I’m hungry. I want to eat kimchi fried rice”  </font>
ㅜㅡㅜ  
And she said <font color="#feab61">“Ah that sounds so good”</font>  
<font color="#feab61">"I’m kinda craving something sour too”  </font>
