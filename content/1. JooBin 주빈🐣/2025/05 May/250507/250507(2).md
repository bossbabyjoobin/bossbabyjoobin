SooMin hears JooBin sleep talking in English

<sup><font color="#92d050">[t/n: JooBin was sleepy since it was late and she was joking about the new album concept. She then said "You probably have no idea what I mean" "Me neither" hence the mention of sleep talking ^~^]</font></sup>

🫧 You're basically just sleep talking right now ㅋㅋㅋ

Oh right, did I ever mention this?  
I don’t remember if I told you  
But apparently I sleep talk in English too
Did I mention that?  
I guess I didn’t  
It wasn’t super recent  
But a while back
SooMin unnie said <font color="#fd83a5">“Bin-ah, you sleep talked in English last night…”</font>  
And I was like <font color="#b7f54c">"That doesn't even make sense…"</font> so I asked her what I said  
But she replied <font color="#fd83a5">“I don’t know”  </font>
So I was like <font color="#b7f54c">"Huh?" "How come you don’t know?" </font> 
And she said <font color="#fd83a5">“Because it was in English”  </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"Aha!" </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">"Okay~"  </font>
But that…
I’d been memorizing an English script the day before
so I probably recited it in my sleep
It was the day before the MBA lecture
