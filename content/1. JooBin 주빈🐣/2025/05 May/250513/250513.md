Binnie’s letter after the showcase

Hi WAV, I wonder if everyone’s asleep right now
Finally,, our long-awaited comeback is here!!  
It’s our second promotion as a full group and since it’s my first comeback since debut, it feels even more special/precious to me

Last year, during ASSEMBLE24 when were promoting Girls Never Die, everything was new to me, I didn’t know anything, and it all passed by quickly while I was just learning. Now that it's my second time now, I've started to feel not just pressure but also a personal desire to do better than last time. I really wanted to pull off this new concept and my parts well, so I put a lot of thought into it and practiced hard to prepare for today. Thankfully, once the showcase ended, all the nerves I had just disappeared

The showcase might be over but really, this is just the beginning of ASSEMBLE25 and 깨어(Are You Alive). Please take care of us, WAV. Let’s meet often from now on ♡ To all the WAVs who came to the showcase today and to those who cheered us on from afar, thank you so so much. Please show 깨어(Are You Alive) lots of love too🤍 Good night 😚✨
