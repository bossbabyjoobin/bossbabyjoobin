Hi WAV!! I'm hereee  
I was planning to come yesterday but I only managed to come now…ㅜㅜ Sorry
Thank you so much, not just for our 1st place on The Show but also for Show Champion! It was such an unbelievable moment
All of this is thanks to WAV!! I’m always so thankful. Thank you so so much for making tripleS shine and for always supporting/cheering us on so passionately

When we got our first win as a full group last year, it felt like a dream and was amazing. I never imagined we’d experience it again this time, so the emotions came rushing back all over again. I felt a bit awkward and surprised but more than anything, I was incredibly happy. I was so happy!!

Even today, seeing so many WAVs gathered and cheering loudly reminded me why I do this. It gives me the drive to keep pushing forward even harder. 
WAV, you are someone really precious to me ♡  

My original goal for this promotion was to give it my all with no regrets because I have WAVs by my side but I think I achieved even more than I imagined. I’ll work even harder for the rest of our promotions too! I’ll be a Binnie who does her best and doesn’t let WAV down!! Stay with me

Thank you so much and I love you. To everyone who came today, you did great
And WAVs coming tomorrow, please be careful on your way  
Wishing everyone a warm night ❤️
I love you. Bye 🫶🏻
