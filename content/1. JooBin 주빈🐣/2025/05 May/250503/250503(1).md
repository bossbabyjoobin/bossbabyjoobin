Manduz couple pose and Binnie’s iconic cheek poke that she’s been doing since debut

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

🫧 Binnie, did you see the Atom02 objekts? The “Just Do It” pose was not included

What ㅜ
That’s a shame…  
But I’m glad the camera pose made the cut
Couple pose with Tone-chan 🫶🏻
Hehe

🫧 The ribbon on top of the head was sooo cute too ㅋㅋ

Hihi  
I liked how there were so many different poses this time
I’ve been doing the cheek poke way too often
so I’ve been trying to cut back on it
But it keeps getting chosen as an objekt every time
ㅋ

Hehe  
There's nothing I can do about it
🫧 This time both of the SCOs were cheek pokes too ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Exactly ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 Instead of your cheek, try poking your eyes or nose

Nose poke! Nose nose poke! Nose nose nose poke
I’ll try nose poke next time  
What even is an ear poke  
I’d probably look like a monkey
🫧 Since Binnie was born in the Year of the Ox, let’s be cows instead

I’m year of the rat!!!!!!!
I was born in January
