Binnie talks about getting ChaeYeon on her Mind Palette test, tripleS’ complicated family tree and how PpoToz helped with her self-introduction for the Music Bank interview

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

🫧 Bin-ah have you tried that thing?  
Like some kind of survey… and at the end, a tripleS member shows up, and if you call, you hear their voice

Yeahhh  
I got ChaeYeon unnie  
So I took a screenshot and sent it to her  
I said <font color="#b7f54c">"Unnie, I think we’re meant to be”  </font>
She saw it and replied
<font color="#66CC33">"Be my younger sibling"  </font>
<font color="#66CC33">"You already have parents"</font> <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[t/n: is it jjinchinz or kkz?? ;) Who knows ^~^]</sup></font>
<font color="#66CC33">"So I'll take the unnie role/position"  </font>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Your family’s just getting bigger and bigger, huh? ㅋㅋ

tripleS family issues…  
Our family tree is something else  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
🫧 Binnie, did you plan that whole “almost the youngest” thing from yesterday’s interview in advance??  
It was seriously so cute..

Actually, there’s a little behind-the-scenes story about that
At first, I was going to go with something more plain/normal introduction like
<font color="#b7f54c">“Hello, I’m tripleS’ Adorable and Lovely, JooBin" </font>
ㅎㅎ  
Well, maybe not that plain/normal but anyway  
Then SooMin unnie next to me suddenly said
<font color="#fd83a5">“Wait right there K-pop, the new one is in the town. </font>
<font color="#fd83a5">Hello. I’m the future of tripleS, Kim SooMin”  </font>
And I was like  
"Eh?" "…What is this"  
So I got some recommendations
SeoYeon unnie and YooYeon unnie gave me a few ideas  
So I combined them together and ended up with
<font color="#b7f54c">“Are you watching, K-pop!! The present of tripleS!! </font>
<font color="#b7f54c">Almost the youngest!! I’m JooBin!!”  </font>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
“The present of tripleS” that was SeoYeon unnie’s idea  
And YooYeon unnie told me to do something cute  
"Almost the youngest!!!!! JooBin!!!"
That's what happened
