Kaede, Tone and their baby JooBin

🫧 On yesterday's SIGNAL~ Kaede kept poking your cheek??  
I don’t usually see you two together

ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋ
We’re always together at the office though
Maybe it’s because we haven’t filmed many SIGNALs together?  
Kaede unnie, Tone unnie and I are always doing the *Hug me* thing 
Then I’ll run over <sup>[t/n: for context, see below]</sup>
But honestly, it’s usually the unnies running to hug me
Hehe 
🤍✨
🫧 During yesterday’s live, SoHyun mentioned that you and Kae have great vocals

🥺🤍


`[나 안아 . .  = Hug me . .]`
