Despite the loud Joo household, nothing beats SooMin’s antics in the dorm + Bin2 says Hi to WAVs

#JooBin #주빈

___
My younger siblings keep talking to me
They’re acting like SooMin unnie 
🫧 Use voice message and record them

Then they'll be quiet
🫧 1 Kim SooMin vs Your younger siblings

SooMin unnie wins
When I tell my younger siblings to be quiet
at least they calm down for a bit
But Soomin unnie changes selectively
Nobody can beat her
Out of nowhere, unnie sent a selfie in our group chat today
Then she disappeared without saying anything

`[8 minutes later...]`

My siblings keep bothering me and running away
These little troublemakers are so lovely  
^^  


`[7 minutes later...]`


Oh right
Yesterday, I was practicing the tour setlist
But my siblings wouldn’t stop bothering me the whole time
^~^  
Aaahhh, finally made it to my room 
<sup>[t/n: She went to her room because it was too noisy in the living room]</sup>
I yelled “Don’t bother me…!!!!!!”  
But my sibling replied
“Unnie, are you Elsa? You're blocking me out like Elsa does? Then I guess I'm Anna”
What am I supposed to say to that? 
She talk so well I was left speechless
..  
Now she’s next to me singing _Into the Unknown_ 
![[250128_JooBin_3.m4a]]  
`[VM: Hiiiii ~]`
It's my younger sib, say Hi
🫧 Huh? Is that your baby sibling???

Well, she's not actually a baby  
but she’ll always be one to me
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 It’s just Bin2 then

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
NXT unnies said we look exactly the same  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ
