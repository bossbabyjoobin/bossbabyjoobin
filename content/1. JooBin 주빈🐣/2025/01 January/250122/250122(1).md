JooBin talks about her cooking SIGNAL with SeoAh 

#JooBin #주빈
___

Hey WAV~  
I just watched my SIGNAL
My cooking SIGNAL 
Finally!
Did you check out my skills? How was it?  
I came here just to say this
ㅋ
But seriously, to all the bungeoppang shop owners in the world
I have so much respect for you all
I love you 🫶🏻
First off, we tried tweaking the recipes and experimenting a bit
So here’s the ranking
1. Corn cheese
2. Sweet potato
3. Custard cream
4. Red bean
5. Sweet potato with cream cheese

The corn cheese one was the best
Custard cream and red bean tasted a bit different from the usual bungeoppang we know, so they ended up lower on the rankings
At first, we mixed sweet potato and cream cheese together 
but the sourness of the cream cheese was too strong
It tasted better when we removed it and just used sweet potato
🫧 Teach me how to pronounce the Thai phrases you taught SeoAh

Yuringring – Stay still  
Niapniap – Shhh <sup>[t/n: Be quiet]</sup>
`[VM: yuringring niap niap]`
![[250122_JooBin_1.m4a]]
I got the pronunciation approved by Sullin unnie  
Apparently, they’re commonly used phrases
I've even heard Sullin unnie use them a few times 
🫧 I’ll try them out with my friends too

Yup, don’t forget to do the hand gestures
🫧 Kawaii( ⸝⸝˃ ᵕ ˂⸝⸝ )✦<sup>[JP]</sup>

Kawaii<sup>[KR]</sup>
The pronunciation is so cute
🫧 Actually, it’s Yuningning but I understood Yuringring tooㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Wait, really?!?!
Oh, you're right
It’s Yuningning  
I checked with Sullin unnie again
Yuringring niapniap
ㅎㅎ 
🫧 YuBinBin NienNien

? Are you trying to fit tripleS members’ names into this?
Anyway, I just had to share this after watching the SIGNAL
I couldn’t wait
ㅎㅎ 
🫧 How about SeoAh? Do you think she’s good at cooking?

Chef Jeong SeoAh, officially appointed
Our baby is really good
🫧 Better than Bin? <sup>[EN]</sup>

I should think about it<sup>[EN]</sup>
Hmmmm
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
But we have great teamwork together
ㅎㅎㅎ 
🫧 If you had to rank tripleS members by cooking skills, who would be the best?

First place is me???? >,< 
Sorry
🫧 First place from the back

?  
WAV, come out for a second  <sup>[t/n: picking a fight]</sup>
What did you say?  
I must’ve misheard, right?  
Right? ^~^  
Please clarify  
First place~ 
From the front  
Or…  
First place in WAV's heart? ㅎㅎ 
🫧 What was that pair of scissors in the dorm used for...?

I didn’t know until today’s SIGNAL
Apparently, they’re for chopping vegetables and stuff into tiny pieces   
Honestly, pros can chop much faster with a knife
🫧 Don’t you have regular scissors?

We have them in our HAUS but they don’t have any in that HAUS
I guess no one there really cooks, so they don’t even have regular scissors
