JooBin's thoughts on songs for the ASSEMBLE25 Title Track Grand Gravity

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

🫧 I'm looking forward to ASSEMBLE25

I didn’t even know it was posted
I wasn’t expecting it to be uploaded this quickly
🫧 How’s the song?

ㅎㅎ  
I like it~~~~~~  
I had no idea the “24” in ASSEMBLE24 was for the year 2024
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
And now for 2025, it’s ASSEMBLE25~~~~~~
I'm watching the SIGNAL one more time  
It’s so fun  
ㅎㅎ 
Hihi
Spoiler?  
I can’t do that
La~~~ <sup>[t/n: of course, another song with "la"]</sup>  
ㅋ

`[15 minutes later...]`

🫧 Binnie, what’s your favorite tripleS song? I'm curious

Hmm  
As of now, Beyond the Beyond
But that could change once the new songs are out~
That’s how mind-blowingly good the songs are..~~~~  
ㅎㅎ  
When I listened to them
I got goosebumps all over my body
Seriously..  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Binnnie, when you listened to ASSEMBLE25, was there a song that stood out to you or were they all just too good?

~Secret~
Once you get to listen to the songs, you'll be like
"Wow.."  
"Ohhhhh…  
"Wow……"
It’s just inevitable  
This is my second title track gravity, right? 
Last year, everything felt so new and I was filled with anticipation
But this time, it’s fascinating, it gave me goosebumps and was so surprising
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I think WAVs will love it  
🫧 Have you ever released a song like this before? <sup>[CN]</sup>

Hmm  
You’ll really understand once you hear it..  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
Just wait ~~  
a little bit longer~~~~~~~~~~~
