The story behind SeoYeon’s blurry pictures

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 Behind-the-scenes story of SeoYeon’s photo that was uploaded today ㅋㅋㅋ Maximum blur ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ No but
We went to Thailand
stopped by a convenience store
and started taking pictures
The pictures were turning out so well that I said
“Unnie, daebak! These are coming out great!”
But then, in the car
Unnie scrolled through them and said
“Bin-ah, except for one, they’re all blurry”
That’s what she said  
Honestly, I felt a little sad  
I swear, none of them looked blurry when I took them
Even when I checked right after, they were fine
🫧 Maybe it’s because it was dark, and night mode turned on?  
You’re supposed to stay still for a few seconds 

But night mode wasn’t even on
After editing them
that’s just how they turned out
🫧 When you take photos at night, they can turn out like that.  
You really need to stay still for about three seconds before moving

ㅠㅠ
