The reason why JooBin was so busy eating egg tarts in the last SIGNAL

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

🫧 Oh right, the egg tart from yesterday’s SIGNAL looked delicious. Everyone seemed to be enjoying it, so I’m curious…

I have something to say about this
That day, for some reason, I wasn’t really hungry
so I only ate one but those egg tarts
I absolutely love them
I’ve always been a big fan  
I’d tried the kaya toast, financier and egg tart from that place before
and they were seriously so delicious  
Back then, I even saved the place to my favorites after ordering them
And as luck would have it, the egg tarts they prepared for us  
were from that exact place
It made me so happy
a little behind-the-scenes story for you…

🫧 SeoAh, who said she doesn’t like desserts, looked so excited

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
As soon as SeoAh saw the desserts 
She asked “Can I eat these..??!”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So cute
