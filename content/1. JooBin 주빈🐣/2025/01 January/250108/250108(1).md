Hold on, let me take off my face pack. Wait a minute
Okay, done~
🫧 What kind of face pack??

A moisturizing one!!  
I think?
Pretty sure that’s right
For me, I usually use one either the night before an important event  
or when I just feel like it
Today, I felt like it, so I did!
🫧 What do you do when you feel like sending a selfie? 

I just send it  
WAVs selcas are always welcome ^~^  
?ㅎㅎ

🫧 Oh, we’re the ones sending selfies..?

ㅎㅎ Yup 
Then in return, I’ll send you pictures

Tada!  
Sorry for not sending pictures on the day of the festival..  <sup>[KBS Song Festival]</sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ve been holding onto these to send later...
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Actually, at that photo spot 
I think I took pictures for about six people
While I was taking pictures of HaYeon unnie  
others members nearby were like 
“Oh! Take one for me too"  "Me too, me too!”  
So I was like “Okay....”
!!!!  
and took turns taking pictures for everyone
🫧 Who did you take pictures of??

I don’t remember exactly  
but definitely HaYeon unnie, ChaeWon unnie, SeoAh and a few others
I took one for Sullin unnie too
Hehe
