JooBin played Overcooked and Mario Kart with SooMin and ChaeWon and realized she's not cut out for gaming

Yesterday, I played Overcooked with SooMin unnie and ChaeWon unnie
and I realized something
I don’t like games because I’m bad at them…
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ve never really liked games
but it turns out that’s just because I’m not good at them
Yesterday, while playing, I finally understood that  
But as I kept playing  
I did get better…  
And then we played Mario Kart? 
At first, I was terrible but I made a comeback
got 1st place and felt this sense of accomplishment  
Another thing I realized is  
...I probably shouldn’t play again next time….  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅅㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It was fun but
...it’s not my style  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱ  
🫧 Then what’s Binnie’s favorite hobby?

Hmm  
Sleeping?  
^~^
🫧 Wow, I do that all the time too. That’s amazing

See? We’re on the same wavelength
