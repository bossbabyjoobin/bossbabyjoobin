WAV, I went to my first-ever birthday café today
Honestly, I got to meet way more WAVs than I expected
and it made me so happy
Today was seriously the best birthday of my 17 years of life
..!!!
🤍  
Thank you so much for all the love and attention you give me WAVs
It’s more than I deserve
I really felt it today and it makes me think I can work even harder!!
I’ll grow so much more (as an artist)
and even taller..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ll show you just how cool I can become
😚😚😚😚😚😚
So, about the birthday café...  
Yesterday, I binge-watched birthday café SIGNALs before going 
It was like a virtual simulation to keep me from panicking, but…
Honestly, I still panicked to the max.
All that prepping was pointless
;;;;;  
It was even more overwhelming than I imagined <sup>[t/n: Typical I's, I can relate]</sup>
Also, I didn’t realize I’d taken so many selfies over the past year
I thought “It’s just one year, there can’t be that many”  
But that wasn't the case
Hehe
🫧 What’s the most memorable moment of the year?

First off, I think today will be the happiest memory of 2025
I’m definitely writing about it in my diary
Hihi
Oh and the cake was incredible
It was so pretty
Like the kind of cake you’d want to keep as a display forever
🤍💚  
🫧 Did you make it your background?

Yep!!!! ㅎㅎ  
🫧 That Binnie macaron was cool too, right?

Yeah, it was my first time seeing printed macarons  
Earlier at the practice room, I asked the members
“Who wants to eat a macaron with 1-year-ago Binnie drawn on it?”  
And they were all like  
“?????? A macaron from a year ago??”  
So I explained 
“No, it’s my 1-year-ago self on it, not a macaron that’s a year old” 
<sup>[t/n: Her official SNS bday pic from last year]</sup>  
...  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋ  
In the end, I shared it with Xinyu unnie
🫧 What birthday gifts did you get?

I got such a variety  
a strawberry cake, a digital camera, face packs, a keyring, skincare products, a hat, hand cream, a plate and more
🎊🎊🎊  
Actually, I got the same digital camera from three people... 
So I was like “Uh-oh, should I say something? What do I do?”  
I just sat there in this state
🫧 Who gave it to you?

Our Baby SeoAh.. 🥹🫶🏻  
But she’s so thoughtful
She said “Unnie, you might already have it, so if you do, just let me know and I’ll give you something else!!”  
🥹🥹🥹🥹 So touched, SeoAh 🫶🏻  
She’s so thoughtful, such a baby
🫧 What’s the plate for…? Do you spill food a lot?

Ah no, it’s a Chunsik plate <sup>[One of JooBin's favaorite characters]</sup>
Hehe  
Isn’t it the cutest?ㅠㅡㅜㅜㅜ
🫧 HaYeon already talked about it

Wow, she’s quick  
Unnie asked me 
“What should I get you for your birthday? Just say the word”  
So I joked “Just the word?”  
And she went “Yeah, just say the word”  
We were laughing about it, but later, she messaged me saying
“I was going to give you something without asking but I don’t want to risk you not using it because I'll be sad, so you pick”  
I was like “...I don’t really know what I want”  
Then I saw a plate in my algorithm and thought “That’s it!”  
So I sent her that 
Heheheh 
😚
🫧 But coming up with 23 gift ideas must be exhausting

..  
In that case, just do what I did today
“It’s okay, your love is enough for me ❤️”  
And if they really can’t decide, just pick one for yourself 
Then it's a done deal
