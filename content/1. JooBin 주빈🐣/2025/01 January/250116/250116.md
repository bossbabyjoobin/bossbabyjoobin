Hehe
Ohhh, my mom just called
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
She wished me a happy birthday
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ킼
I wonder who’ll be first

`[12:00 am... (Birthday greetings pouring in ^~^)]`

I'm so touched 
I can’t believe it
Oh my gosh  
This is insane
Seriously
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ
So the first place is 
a tie for first place  
Sullin unnie was the first one to say it <sup>[t/n: IRL]</sup>
She pretended to be asleep
she said “I’ll shower later, you go first”  
and went to sleep 
But it was all an act...  
ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ
At exactly 12:00, she said "Happy Birthday!!!!!!”

And finally, the highly anticipated first in the group chat goes to…!!!!  
Tone unnie!!!!!!  
But there’s more
There’s another first-place winner...  
Three people in total…  
The next one is…  
ChaeYeon unnie 🫶🏻  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
She wins the Comedy Award
In the room with the members and our manager…  
She said "First place..!!!!!!!!"
She told everyone about my birthday
❤️
