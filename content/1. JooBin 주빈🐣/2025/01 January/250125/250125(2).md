5 SeoYeon vs 5 DaHyun (Wholesome ver.)

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

🫧 Binnie, 5 SeoYeon unnies vs 5 DaHyun unnies?

That’s new <sup>[t/n: The balance game, since it’s usually YeonJi vs SooMin or HaYeon]</sup>
They're so different
Like, 5 SeoYeon unnies
It feels like having five older sisters who are kind of cute but also reliable, giving me practical advices and always by my side protecting me
5 DaHyun unnies 
First of all, you get to enjoy a treat for your ears all day, eat delicious food together and have your happiness level maxed out...
Is there an option to choose one for today and the other for tomorrow?
