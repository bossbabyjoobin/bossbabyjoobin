JooBin reveals HaYeon's lie from the SIGNAL live

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm
___
I'm sleepy
Can you recommend a good song to listen to while falling asleep?
Thank you
🫧 Let’s listen to *Do it Do it*



`[VM: I'm really sorry but that's a song that will wake you up completely]`
![[250125_JooBin_3.m4a]]  
`[VM: Do it🎵 Do it🎵 ~~ This is how it wakes you up]`

🫧 What if you end up meeting NXT in your dream?  

That’d be tough...
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Today, I gave ShiOn unnie  
a protein bar as a gift...  
HaYeon unnie almost kissed me  
I didn’t see Lynn unnie today 
but she must’ve been thinking of me, right?   
😚  
Haha 
🫧 During the last SIGNAL live (with HaYeon), HaYeon said she doesn’t bother with the babies, so she won’t bother with JooBin, YeonJi and SeoAh <sup>[t/n: 💋]</sup>

Then what about what happened to me during NXT? 
<sup>[t/n: JooBin got her fair share of HaYeon's ppoppo attacks back in the day]</sup> 
*Sigh* 
I can’t be the only one
I’ll make a bold statement
YeonJi unnie and SeoAh, you two need to go through this too
🫧 But wouldn’t it be fun to have a younger sibling like HaYeon?

Except she’s my unnie.
