JooBin's heartfelt message to WAVs

WAV!! Hi ♡  
I’ve made it back to Korea safely!!! Before heading to bed, I wanted to share so many things after wrapping up the first leg of our tour… I tried to organize my thoughts a bit and send them your way 😚😚

It’s hard to believe that it’s already been a year since I joined tripleS and that we’ve finished the first leg of our tour..!! I just want to say thank you to all our WAVs who’ve been with us every step of the way!! I’m so so so grateful and I love you so much 🫶🏻

It was so nice to visit Sullin unnie’s hometown for the tour, meet so many Thai WAVs and creating wonderful memories together 😛 From our first performances to full-group songs, we prepared a variety of stages to show you how cool we could be. But I feel like there’s still so much I could’ve done better and for that, I feel really sorry and regretful 🥲🥹
But I’m not giving up, I’ll keep practicing hard and keep improving throughout our upcoming concerts, so be sure to keep an eye on me!!

Even when things were tough and I felt exhausted, hearing WAVs' cheers on stage gave me the strength to keep going and I was able to push through until the end. WAVs will always be something precious and dear to me

I want to be that kind of strength and presence for WAVs too!
To my beloved WAVs, rest well and sleep tight 🤍
