WAVVVVVVVVVV
Are you still awake??
We’ve arrived safely in Thailand
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
`[VM: My roommate is.... *Drum rolls* ]`
![[250110_JooBin_1.m4a]]`[VM: Sullin unnie!! Waaaah!!]`
![[250110_JooBin_2.m4a]]I totally guessed it right ㅋ <sup>[Bin's predications were SeoAh, Sullin or HaYeon]</sup>
Isn’t that amazing?
Hehe
When we found out we’d be roommates
both of us were like, “Yeahhhhhh ~~~~~ !”
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
We’re already roommates (in the HAUS) 
so it feels comfortable
Hehe
🫧 Binnie, what time is it there?

It’s 11 PM here!  
Two hours behind Korea 
🫧 Did you have dinner…?

Yupp, I ate earlier
and I could really taste the local flavors...  
We ordered a bunch of dishes and tried a little of everything
What did I eat again?  
I had like 0.1 spoon of Tom Yum Goong
Then I just ate the mango from mango sticky rice...  
Looked at the Pad Thai but didn’t eat it 
What was that again?  
Oh wait  
Is Pad Thai the noodles?  
Stir-fried noodles, right?  
The Pad Thai was so delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
For a second, I got it mixed up with Som tam
I didn’t eat the Som Tam
I had morning glory and drank watermelon juice
Tonight’s top picks are Pad Thai and morning glory
For dessert, it's the watermelon juice
🫧 Are these all Sullin's recommendations?

Yup, she ordered everything for us
As each dish came out, I kept asking 
“🐣Unnie, what’s this?”  
“☃️This is Som tam~~ This is Pad Thai~”  
“🐣Ahhhh okay”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Can you eat cilantro, Binnie? 🌱

🥲❌  
It tastes like soap...
🫧  You have to try Pu Pad Pong Curry tomorrow. It was the best thing I ate today ㅠ

I was actually planning to eat it todayㅠ  
HaYeon unnie wanted curry too
and we were all waiting
but I guess the order didn’t go through…
because it never came out...  
I’ll try it tomorrow
🫧 It must be super hot, right? You can probably wear skirtsㅋㅋㅋ

Surprisingly, it’s not that hot
🫧 How’s the weather in Thailand?

Before coming, Sullin unnie told me it’d be 32°C   
so I was like “Oh wow, I’m going to melt”  
I mentally prepared for it  
But honestly, it feels fine
It’s even cool at times
The AC indoors is so strong  
that it’s actually cold...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
