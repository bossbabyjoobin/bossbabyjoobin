JooBin's mindset and goals for world tour

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm
___

🫧 Are you nervous??

Kind of  
It still doesn’t feel real that we’re in Thailand right now...  
It’s like, if I open my eyes, I’ll be on stage  
and if I close and open them again, I’ll be back in Korea

🫧 What kind of mindset do you want to have as you take on your first concert (on this tour)?

I want to learn a lot through this tour 
I’ve done showcases and music show promotions  
but this is my first tour and it’s just the beginning...!!  
I feel like I’m a little sprout 💚🍀 
I’m determined to learn a lot, grow and come back stronger ~~ 
That’s the mindset I have
