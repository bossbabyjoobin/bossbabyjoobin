🫧 The keyring that YuBin gave you!!! Tell us about it~ ㅋㅋㅋ

Oh rightttt  
Was it yesterday? or the day before?…  
Time is spinning in my head 
so I’m a little confused but  
it was the afternoon of January 30th in Korea
ㅎㅎ
YuBin unnie knocked on our room
all bundled up in her long padding  
and called out "Bin-ahhhh~"  
So I was like "Unnieee, what is it?" and went over
Then Yubin unnie goes "Tada!"
and gave me this cute keyring
I was like "OMG, what is this!!! It’s so cute"  
I thanked her, took it 
and immediately put it on my phone
Look look

She said she remembered when I got keyrings for all the members last time, so she bought one for me
Hehe

Because I take after my mom and dad

🫧 The zoomed-in keyring is way too cute ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

It was too small to see properly 
so I cropped it from a mirror selfie I took right after getting it
🫧 That’s some MZ editing…??
