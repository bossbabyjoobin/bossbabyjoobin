JooBin and SooMin's sibling-like friendship

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 JooBin, you must never get bored with Soomin around

Yup.… thanks to her

🫧 What would JooBin do without SooMin?

What would SooMin do without JooBin? ✅  
When I go on tour,  she’ll probably miss me and send messages every day
*Sigh*
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋ
Now, I’ve settled inside my tent and on my bed
It’s so cozy and warm  
Lynn unnie saw my tent for the first time today and was shocked
So I was like “Huh? Unnie, you’ve never seen it before?”
Apparently, we’re always in the living room when she visits
And WAVs haven’t seen it even once either?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Actually, I was planning to show it to you during JooManSa but…  
ㅜㅡㅜ  
Too bad it didn’t work out
🫧 At least show us a picture later…

One of these days, I’ll jump and take a wide-angle shot
🫧 You should’ve locked SooMin in the tent every time she dragged things out ㅋㅋㅋ <sup>[t/n: Like in JooManSa EP]</sup>

Earlier, SooMin unnie saw me lying inside my tent and said
“That looks comfy. Can I go in?”
?
So I was like “…Sure, come in”  
She sat inside, took my charger, plugged in her phone and we chatted for a while before she went to shower
