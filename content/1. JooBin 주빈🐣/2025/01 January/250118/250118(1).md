Hoohoo  
30 minutes until JooManSa’s release
^~^
Guess who it is?
ㅎㅎ  
It seems like everyone’s narrowing it down to two or three people
🫧 It's Jeong Ha-seok~ <sup>[t/n: HaYeon's alter ego]</sup>

Huh?  
ㅋㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋ  
🫧 Rine? ChaeWon? SooMin?

Hehe  
It's a secret~  
Hihi  
Just wait 20 more minutes (and you’ll find out)
🫧 That teaser pic, Binnie looks so cute lying on the bed <sup>[CN]</sup>

I've been defeated..
I'm waiting too so I can share behind-the-scenes stories 
Here's a little spoiler
That day was the longest JooManSa shoot ever...  
50 minutes...  
🫧 Was it the longest because it was fun?

...Yup
🫧 Let’s watch it in 30 minutes and chat about the behind-the-scenes

Sounds good 
I’ve been waiting since the hint was posted
🫧 Who talks more, YeonJi or today’s guest?

YeonJi unnie talked a lot about one topic  
but today’s guest just kept talking nonstop
🫧 But why is the baby lying down??

After 50 minutes of filming, that's the *defeated MC* pose  
Haha...  
I was messaging today’s guest earlier
but they still haven’t read my last message from 30 minutes ago
A bit disappointing
*Sigh*
🫧 Was this the one you filmed a while ago and hinted the guest was a cute member?

Yep ^~^  
A cute member  
Her height is cute
ㅋ  
🫧 07z only has weird members though?

They’re cute...
