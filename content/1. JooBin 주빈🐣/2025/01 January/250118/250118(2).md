1 minute left!!!!  
Let’s talk again after watching JooManSa 👀👀  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It was fun
50 minutes of content
There was so much footage that the content team kept saying
“Stop...!! please stop...”  
"Guess how long we've been filming?" 
"We filmed for 50 minutes"  
SooMin unnie thought it had only been 20 minutes
...
Oh, you're still watching?  
There’s a special post-credit scene today  
By the way, that cute cookie with the crown  
I made that almond cookie  
and the drawing, I drew it myself
`[t/n: This is what JooBin's talking about here, It's in the video]`

Isn’t it cute?  
and It’s delicious
Ahhh.. am I the only one watching at 2x speed?  
Sorry for the spoilers
ㅎㅎ
🫧 Have you ever deleted SooMin’s selfies on your phone?

Not yet
I’ll think about it when I run out of storage
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋ  
It’s her gift, so it’s hard to delete
Speaking of SooMin unnie’s JooManSa episode
For my birthday, she gave me this green Shrek-themed mask pack
So that night, I washed up and tried it
But I was like “What is this...?” 
<sup>[t/n: Remember the SeoYeon Cinnamoroll mask pack?]</sup>  
<sup>[Just imagine that but with Shrek😂check tweet below]</sup>  
I sent her a proof shot and I said “Is this right...?”  
SooMin unnie replied with “I want to kiss you”  
I wasn’t expecting that, so I ignored it 
and just said Good night
🫧 How did you even manage to MC this episode... it sounds intense

The editing team did an amazing job condensing it
Thank you, MODHAUS contents team
🫧 Let's release the unedited version ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Do you think you could watch it all?
^~^  
Even the parts where they said it would be uploaded as shorts…
Yeah, it’s a screen time issue
There’s just way too much footage
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ
Honestly, SooMin unnie spent 10 minutes just talking about the food she ate in Japan  
"🐣Can I move on...?"
“🐿️But I ate this too”  
"🐣Are you done?"
“🐿️Wait, this as well”  
"🐣Done..?"
"🐿️No, wait a minute"
I think this happened about five times
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋ  
Before filming, I hadn’t eaten anything
so I ordered food to eat after the shoot
But the shoot ran late, so I was hungry the whole time
🫧 Isn’t it your fault for assuming SooMin’s episode would be short? ㅋㅋ

My mistake ☆
