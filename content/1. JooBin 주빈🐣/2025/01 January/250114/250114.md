The relationship between the eldest member, YooYeon and the second youngest, JooBin 

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm
___

🫧 Binnie, do you find YooYeon hard to approach? YooYeon is curious 

Right now? At this hour??
Is unnie chatting on fromm too?
No…  
Actually, you’re right…  
I had a really definite moment  
It’s after I gave her a keyring...!   
ㅎㅎ
Usually, when I give keyrings to the members, they say thank you on the spot, and I feel proud, and that’s the end of it
But with YooYeon unnie, she texted me later that day
I was like “Huh?” and checked it 
Unnie thanked me for the keyring and even sent an emoticon with it  
When I saw that, I was so touched and it warmed my heart… hehe
🫧 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ You were moved by that?!

I think I’m more moved by little things
To me, it was a big deal… 
🥹  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Why did you find her hard to approach at first?

Honestly, it wasn’t just YooYeon unnie
As a super introvert, I found everyone hard to approach at first…  
Even with YeonJi unnie, who’s super friendly, I only started speaking casually with her after the Authentic concert company dinner
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It wasn’t really that she was "*hard to approach*"
It was more like "*Is it okay for me to be this casual with her?*" <sup>[8-year age gap]</sup>
That phase lasted for quite a while  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 If I moved into a house with 16 people, I’d just sit down and cry right away <sup>[t/n: teasing Binnie because she cried before when she first met the members]</sup>

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅠ  
Also, before Gayo Daechukje, both of us were so busy with separate schedules <sup>[Festival scheds for JooBin]</sup>
YooYeon unnie for VV and Hatchi promotions
So we didn’t see each other much
But while practicing for Gayo Daechukje, I met unnie after a long time and during tutting practice, I was near YooYeon unnie because of the formation
So while practicing, I really started feeling more comfortable with her?!!
That kind of feeling ~
🫧 So, are you close enough to playfully tap her shoulder now?

..? Why would I tap her shoulder just because I'm comfortable with her
You cannot do that, WAV.
🫧 YooYeon’s really looking forward to JooManSa

Ahhh JooManSa
The next episode is already filmed…  
But I don’t know when it’ll be uploaded.
🫧 Is it a member?

Yes?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ It’s a secret 
ㅋ  
It’s been so long since we filmed it
Hehe
The answer is a secret but here’s a hint…  
Someone kinda… cute?
