The magic of HaYeon's grilled mushrooms turned three picky eaters into mushroom lovers

I had so so sooo many things I wanted to say
but I can’t remember any of them
Oh right
Yesterday, I was trying to figure out what to eat
so I went out to the living room
and Sullin unnie was eating sweet and sour chicken 
She had leftovers and was super full. She kept saying 
“☃️ Eat this! Eat this!!! Please”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So I didn’t bother making anything else
and just ate the sweet and sour chicken unnie gave me
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
She said she had too much left and was about to throw it out
but I showed up at the perfect time, so she insisted I eat it
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Then out of nowhere, HaYeon unnie said
“If you eat this, you’re going to keep eating ~~ !”  
And I was like “Can unnie really convince me to do that?”  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋ  
But then, strangely enough... 
It actually tasted like meat...  
I used to be the kind of person who’d go  
“What are you talking about?”  
whenever someone said “Mushrooms taste like meat when grilled ~~~ ”  
But now I get it...!!!!!!!  
What’s even crazier is that HaYeon unnie’s grilled mushrooms  
turned three picky eaters into mushroom lovers
Those three were me, SooMin unnie and DaHyun unnie 
We were eating the mushrooms and are reactions were
“…!!!!!!! What?!"  
"How does it taste like meat?"  
"Wow…”  
And now, I eat grilled mushrooms
Hehe
🫧 Do you eat malatang without mushrooms?

Oh right
I still haven’t tried wood ear mushrooms 
but I think I’ll give them a shot someday
Trying new things has been kinda fun
