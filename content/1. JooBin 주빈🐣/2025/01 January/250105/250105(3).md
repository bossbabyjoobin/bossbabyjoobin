JooBin talks about the 06z becoming adults and getting comfortable with the unnie line

🫧 Binnie, you’re stepping into adulthood now that it’s a new year

ㅎ  
No, it’s just that while practicing  
we started playing _Do It_ and chatting with HaYeon unnie
That’s when it hit me
I’m now the same age HaYeon unnie was when NXT was released
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹  
So we were both like  
“OMGGG 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹"  
"Wow, we’ve been here so long… time’s flying way too fast…"  
and we ended up reminiscing about the old days
🫧 When Binnie becomes an adult, all hell's gonna broke loose

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I still can’t believe that the 06z unnies are already adults... 🥹  
Half of NXT are all adults now  
It’s unreal
By next year,  I’ll be the only teenager left
Aaaahhhhhh 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹  
Time flies so fast 
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
🫧 … So basically, only 07z, 08z, 09z, and 10z aren’t adults yet in tripleS…

Wowㅜ  
That’s crazy…
🫧 Ehngg? But that’s still a lot?  

Well… yeah, since there are 24 of us, it does seem like a lot
But it’s actually only 7 people
ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Now, if it's less than 12 people
it feels like a small number
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋ
🫧 Be honest, isn’t it still tough with the older unnies? ㅋㅋㅋ 
<sup>[Unnie line | Yooyeon, 02z, 03z]</sup>

At first, it was 
and honestly, I thought it’d still feel that way even after a year  
But it didn’t 
By the end of last year  
I’d gotten comfortable with them ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
