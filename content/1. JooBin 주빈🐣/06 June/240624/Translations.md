🐣 I told the unnies I love them 
🐣 🌊 They must've been touched after reading it 
🐣 The reactions were completely different
🐣 Lynn unnie
🐣 ♡sent an emoticon♡
🐣 Saying 'I love you' in exactly the same way
🐣 ShiOn unnie sent a cute 'I love you' emoticon
🐣 HaYeon unnie replied with Good good (굳굳)
🐣 ..
🐣 T seriously (t/n: T = MBTI)
🐣 Mood spoiler 
🐣 Those two letters (t/n = 굳굳 = good good)
🐣 …….

🐣 NXT
🐣 I love you
