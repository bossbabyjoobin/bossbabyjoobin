Hello, WAV
🌊🌊🌊
How's your day going?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
The WAVs I met in Daegu
were all soaking wet..
Me too..
My hair is still damp..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ킼
🫧 Binnie, you were soaked tooㅠ

But
it was fun
with the unnies
getting rained on
and singing the lyrics
bibaram jom deo sege <sup>[KR: 비바람 좀 더 세게 | EN: The Stronger The Rain  – It's Rising Lyrics]</sup>
which was kinda funny
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
After the stage, we got off
and everyone went, "Woooahhhh"
Great job, everyone
We were like,
"Let’s record a video to commemorate us getting rained on"
Everyone was saying thatㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
The end ~~~~~ !!!!!!!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 But have you already arrived in Seoul??

Nope, still on the way
I was about to sleep,
but I thought of this,
so I stopped by
`~~~~~~`
Oh, and
while we were wrapping up after the stage,
I kept calling for Chiyu
and endlessly repeating the chorus
Fallin’ in the water~~~~~~<sup>[JooBin/Naky's part]</sup>
Divin’ under water~~~~~~<sup>[JiWoo/DaHyun's part]</sup>
I will come down as rain…… now.. <sup>[SoHyun/Kaede's part]</sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
TripleS
has something
with water
It’s inevitable
Water.. wind and rain.. waves..
Phew
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I thought the stage would be slippery, but no one fell. Impressive 😢

Luckily, all the members finished the stage safely, I think~
Thanks to WAVs' cheers,
we enjoyed the stage even in the rain~
This was the first time
we performed while getting rained on,
but I think doing it once in a while
is actually nice ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ
Doing something like this for the first time with WAVs…….
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ🤍🤍
🫧 Now, is it going to rain wherever JooBin goes?

Hold on,
I take that back
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 They say teams that get rained on hit it big

Oh, really..???
Maybe I don’t need to take it back ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You were amazing today 🥹

🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍 WAV, you did great too
🫧 A WAV who went today said they caught a coldㅠ

Oh no
When you get home,
take a warm shower
and keep your body warm..ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
Be careful not to catch a cold……
🫧 You too! Don’t catch a cold

Don’t worry~
I'm super strong
💪💪💪💪💪💪
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You were so pretty today that I fell for you all over again~

Awesome
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
WAVs wearing raincoats
looked cute too~~~~~~~~
^~*
🫧 What did you eat today, Binnie?

I had a sandwich today
and fish cake at the rest stop
The rest, I just nibbled on
Ya-me-chu?
Pork bone stew.. Kimchi stew.. Soybean paste stew..
Warm soup..!!
Lunch recommendation too? ㅇㅋ
Lunch recommendation is
since I’ll eat after sleeping,
short rib soup..
No wait
Lunch recommendation is
meat rice bowl
Something hearty
Hah
Right now,
I'm listening to music
Something calm
Sunbae Park Hye-won’s
“Like a wilted flower, watered🎵”
That’s the song I’m listening to now!!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Calm… ~~~ !!!!!!!~!!!!!!!
That kind of song
ㅎ
🫧 I’m in Daegu right now, eating eggs and sikhye at a jjimjilbang

Wow,
sounds delicious
But you know, roasted eggs
have to be cracked on the head
Of course, I don’t do that,
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
My younger sibling used to crack mine on their head
every time
Maybe they found it fun……
Every time I’d go
("Okay, have it")
Yes, you do it
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Then they’d crack it and eat it
With roasted eggs, you just
lay them flat on the table, crack them with a tap
and if you roll them around, the shell comes right off
But cracking them on your head……..
All that does is
kill brain cells…..
🫧 You can’t crack a raw egg on your head, right?

..Yeah, I suppose you can’t
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Brain Cells Never Die.....

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋNever Die…..
🫧 Do you like dipping eggs in salt when you eat them? 🥚

I like eating them just as they are
I enjoy the natural egg flavor
Rather than bland,
it’s more like mild?
Tasty
Ah
Rising is out
“I know your heart
smiling at me”
🫧 Wait.. ㅋㅋ Are you guys not sleeping? Seoyeon is chatting too ㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Seoyeon unnie,
why aren’t you sleeping?
What are you doing?
🫧 It’s Seoyeon, I’m thinking about Binnie

Lies.
I caught you
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Goodnight~
🫧 Today’s Seoyeon unnie’s TMI:

She had tonkatsu today
probably
🫧 I miss Binnie

Me too
I miss myself
Just kidding ㅎ
I miss WAV~~~~~~~~~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Ah Binnie, I was typing "I love you"

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I miss the fairy; Binnie’s main protector is the fairy

..Seems like the fairy is busier than me
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🧚🏻‍♀️😴😴😴
Now I’ll
follow the unnies
and go to sleep~
Goodbye
