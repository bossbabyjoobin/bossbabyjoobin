Hi  
Entrance  
!!  
What are you doing  
Ohho  
I’m thinking of Wave? ㅎ  
Actually, I'm drying my hair  
^~*  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Drying my hair while receiving From is becoming a routine, it seems.

Slightly  
It’s become a routine these days  
Originally, I used to dry my hair fully  
and lie down,  
but now I lie down later,  
so I moved one step forward.  
ㅋㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bina, do you hate drying your hair or washing it more?

I hate drying it...  
Washing finishes quickly,  
but drying takes longer.  
It’s a time issue.  
🫧 Bina, what kind of expression did you make today on Signal when Jiyun said you were cute?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Well, that’s kinda...  
There’s a little episode.  
While practicing the nonscale choreography,  
we kept filming, monitoring, and repeating.  
During my part, the "Hi Welcome" part,  
I was turned around waiting, and I was communicating with Kae unnie with expressions…?!  
🥹 (I must not mess up)  
😉 (I can do this!!)  
We communicated like that.  
But since the dance video was filmed facing the mirror,  
you couldn’t see Kae unnie's expression,  
only mineㅋㅋㄱㅋㅅㄱㅋㅅㅋ was visible.  
So while monitoring,  
one member noticed,  
and the other 23 members laughed...  
That’s the episode.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But as for what kind of expression it was,  
I don’t really know,  
but the members told me  
that it’s a face I make often.  
I don’t even know.  
If I find out later,  
I’ll show you.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bina, you were almost crying while eating the tart? Was it that delicious?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Wow  
Really  
Seriously  
The taste that relieved all the fatigue of that day.  
It was that delicious...  
It’s something I really like,  
kinda creamy but sweet and crispy oh  
That kind of taste.  
Phew…  
If I go back to The Show,  
I will definitely eat it again.  
^~^~^~^  
Oh, sorry.  
M Countdown...  
I got confused because it was behind The Show.ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
The fun part of Signal is  
that I get to watch one every day.  
At night, one by one.  
Oh right, that’s what it was.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋ fun.  
🫧 Bina, even though you see the members every day, is Signal still fun?

It’s a bit of a different feeling?  
When we're together, it feels like fun with friends,  
but Signal is more...  
funny.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Yup, Bina is funny too ^~^~^~^

I knew itㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 So why was your index finger hurting?

…I don’t know.  
It’s fine now.  
Does your index finger hurt when you don’t sleep?  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 While watching Signal, did you ever think, “Oh, why did I do that…”?

Too many times?  
Rather than "why did I do that,"  
it’s more like "I did that?"  
Confusion… hehehehe  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bina, you do surprisingly funny things subtly.

It’s like,  
when I try, it doesn’t show,  
but when I don’t try, it shows.  
There’s a lot of that...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 When you try, it's not funny.

ㅋ  
Oh, right.  
Today at school,  
there was this activity to activate the frontal lobe  
through a nonsensical quiz…  
It was like guessing words represented by pictures.  
Really  
Unbelievably,  
I got them all right without missing a single one...  
For the sake of my image, I couldn’t say anything out loud...  
Unintentionally,  
I already knew the answers.  
I only told my friend next to me,  
and my friend was like,  
“What are you?”  
With a serious face.  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ…  
🫧 Isn’t it good for your image to get them right?

..It was just a nonsense... dad joke...  
🫧 What kind of image harm comes from that, Bina? Your image is already like that.

Unless I'm texting,  
this isn’t really my image.  
…ㅎ  
Heh  
Just kidding ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bina, tripleS’ top no-fun member.

But that’s still number one, right?  
Good,  
that’s nice.  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bina, have you done any baking lately?

I’ve realized something…  
It’s better to not bake at all than to waste ingredients?  
Something like that?  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Oh, our Bina has matured...

……..Thank you  
But  
Signal is  
in the queue.  
I’ve already submitted it.  
Baking with Jyu unnie  
for a solo cooking Signal.  
🫧 Are you wasting the ingredients again?

..That’s why I submitted it with Jiwoo unnie.  
🫧 Oh, so Jiwoo makes it and you eat it?

It might end up like that?  
Is that why it’s in the queue?  
Oh  
Maybe that’s itㅎㅎ  
Since we’re talking about food,  
I'll give you tomorrow’s food recommendation.  
Tomorrow,  
bagel and fruit yogurt!!!  
Because  
I’m going to eat yogurt tomorrow.  
😙😙  
🫧 How about taking food recommendations from us?

As soon as I knew tomorrow's schedule,  
I made a plan.  
Can't be helped.  
🫧 What flavor yogurt do you like the most???

Plain!!  
Plain > Strawberry > Grape  
🫧 Do you also like Yoajeong?

Haven’t tried it yet.  
🫧 What about Greek yogurt?

I prefer yogurt with more whey.  
Something sauce-thick  
is the best.  
🫧 Yakult vs Yogurt

Yogurt!!!  
Absolutely.  
🫧 Do you like Biyotte?

It used to be my everyday breakfast.  
I love yogurt so much  
I ate it every day.  
🫧 I once got scolded for pouring Biyotte the wrong way.

?  
Why would you…  
Do you also mix all kinds of drinks together,  
or combine multiple sauces?  
My little sibling always did that.  
Every time, I wondered,  
why  
would they do that.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bina, can you recommend a song?

Hmm  
I have one  
🎵 *Tonight Tonight* - Hot Chelle Rae  
A song I listen to  
in the morning to get hyped!  
The intro is so exciting,  
but since it’s night now,  
listen to it tomorrow morning.  
🫧 Wow, that’s a song from 2011 🫨

..ohhh  
🫧 Oh, the “Oh la la la” part is on.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Oh, is it not there?

Sleep well~~~  
면  
Sleep  
🫧 면

Oh, this works  
I’m going to sleep  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Tell me a joke, then I’ll sleep.

Strawberry jam  
Chocolate jam  
ㅋ  
🫧 No jam.
