![[240909_1.m4a]][Y/N] What is this?  
🫧 Binnie, come out!

Just appearing like that  
Hyooh  
🫧 Did you have a good day today?

Yes!!  
🫧 How did you just appear right when I wanted to see you!!☺️🤍

We’re totally in sync  
🫧 Don’t you think of me? I think of you every day

Isn’t that almost like a ballad lyric?  
^~^  
I think of Weibo  
a bit  
Haha  
🫧 How was your day, Binnie?

Just sleepy and happy  
😚😴😄  
🫧 A bit?

Hahaha  
A lot? Haha  
🫧 Why are you sleepy?

I was going to sleep deeply, but I woke up at 7 AM...  
I went back to sleep but woke up again at 8...  
Gave up  
Haha  
🫧 Don’t you need to sleep early today if you have school tomorrow?

Yeah...  
I’m actually feeling sleepy right now  
Hehe  
But I’m drying my hair, so it’s okay  
Today, I worked out hard again  
While working out, I got a call from my mom  
Huff... Mom... Huff... Why...  
Hahaha  
My mom said, "I’ll call you later... message me ~~~ "  
Haha  
🫧 Sion said she takes you to exercise, did you go together?

... That’s kind of scary?  
I prefer working out alone  
Haha  
I’ll prepare my stamina in advance before Sion unnie trains me...  
Haha  
🫧 How about a special exercise episode for JuManSa’s Sion unnie? Haha

Can that be postponed to the last segment..?  
Hahaha  
Sigh  
With Sion unnie, I’d rather do a bread mukbang...  
Asking about exercise is difficult  
Not that I’m scared, haha  
What do you think? Haha  
🫧 What does Sion do during exercise that makes everyone

It’s more like  
She’s really perfect with the basics of exercise,  
with flawless posture,  
calmly  
building up muscles bit by bit...  
Training!  
🫧 Does Sion check angles too? Like your posture and stuff?

Yes, that’s why I decided not to squat in front of Sion unnie  
^~^  
Today, I tried salmon and avocado  
It was amazing  
After eating a futomaki, I suddenly wanted to try something today  
Not bad  
It’s not something I’d go out of my way to eat yet,  
but it’s been added to my list of foods I can eat  
Haha  
Honestly, the avocado didn’t taste like anything... eating it together made it even more flavorless  
I didn’t like the texture or sea scent of salmon, but  
eating it all at once with futomaki neutralized the texture and scent, so it was okay  
🫧 "Futomaki" sounds like a cute word

Like me?  
Hehe  
Thanks  
Sorry.  
Haha  
I mean, can you believe the Japan showcase is already this week...??  
I’m nervous  
But honestly, I’m not nervous right now  
🫧 Can you give us a spoiler about what songs you’ll perform at the showcase? Haha

La la la  
Haha  
🫧 Wow, how ridiculous

^~^~^~^~^~  
🫧 You said a member with the letter "K" would join next JuManSa. What’s the difference between that and the 14 members? Haha

Haha  
You’re right  
🫧 Is Binnie’s next greeting going to be "I’m baby Juvin"?

Hmm, I’ll take suggestions  
🫧 How about "Boss Baby Juvin"?

Oh  
I like it  
I’ll research it  
By the way, there was a scary story earlier  
I was sitting in the living room trying to dry my hair  
The other members were all in their rooms  
I was alone in the living room  
Suddenly, the AI started counting  
“One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six…”  
It started counting out loud by itself  
I was like, where is that coming from???  
?-?...  
I listened closely, and it was coming from the TV area  
I told it, "Genie, be quiet"  
And turned it off  
But there was literally no one else in the room but me  
I didn’t say anything  
It just kept trying to start a conversation...  
But then I realized  
Suminee unnie was singing in her room  
Maybe that’s why?  
That could be it  
I wasn’t scared anymore  
🫧 Having Suminee at home being quiet would be scarier

Hahaha  
I’m going to sleep now  
I’m so sleepy  
^~*  
-.  
Goodnight  
![[240909_2.m4a]] Goodnight  
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
Sweet dreams  
Tomorrow’s Monday, so let’s have a fighting spirit!  
Haha  
Goodnight!!!!  
🤍
