[Y/N]!!!
I came up with tomorrow's recommendation!
In the early days, I used to eat yubuchobap (stuffed tofu sushi) with the unnies a lot.
Suddenly remembered it.
The thick kind of yubuchobap
With all the toppings on top!!!
🫧 Have you tried tofu yubu?

Yes, I really like it.
🫧 Does the yubuchobap have toppings? (Fried tofu rice ball)

Yeah, like scrambled eggs, tuna mayo, yukhoe (raw beef), bulgogi.
Stuff like that.
🫧 I think you mentioned eating it on Signal too 🙂‍↕️

Yes, but that one was small.
There's a bigger version with all sorts of toppings.
I prefer the big ones 👻👻👻
🫧 How many thick yubu can you eat?

3...??!!
🫧 Wow, that's more than I thought.

Selective portions.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
If I like it, I eat well.
If I don't, I just fill my stomach.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Isn’t everyone like that~~~~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I can't figure out what food Binie really likes.

Sweet, nutty, soft, chewy.
Is that too broad?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 If you wouldn’t gain weight, pick five foods you could eat endlessly.

Bread, rice cakes, fruits, milk, ice cream.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
If weight isn't a concern.
If it was, homemade meals are the best for me.
^~^
Like,
Bread is something I can't give up on in my life...
It's like WAVs... an essential existence..✨✨
ㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Subtly mentioning us to make me happy, huh? ㅋ

(How did you know~?)
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ
You figured me out well ^~^~^~^

아니 근데
최근에
물론 이미 가을이 됐지만
너무 더워서
시원한 게 생각나는 거야
그래서 진짜 오랫동안 안 마샸던 딸기라떼를
마셨어
!!!!
🍓🥛😚😚😚
역시나 맛있더라
휴
그리고 오늘..
하연언니랑 딸기빙수 먹었어
캬
짱맛있어
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ히히
역시나 맛있엉
🫧 빈이 딸기라떼는 좋아하는데 딸기우유는 별로 안 좋아하는 이유를 물어봐도 될까 혹쉬???

딸기우유는
좀 인위적인 맛이
있달까
딸기아이스크림도 별로 안 조아해
아 근데 바나나우유는 인위적인데 맛있네
그냥 취향인 듯 ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 딸바나 초바는 마셔봤어?

초바가
진짜 맛있어
초딩때 마시고 안 마셨지만
그래도 맛있어
그냥
단 맛 + 단 맛
초코랑 바나나의 단 맛을
다 끌어온 맛…….
🫧 망고 좋아해 빈이?

망고는
쥬스만 좋아해
어라라라ㅏ
이것도 살짝 이상한ㄷㅔ
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ
냉동망고 생망고 노
애플망고 굳
망고쥬스 망고요구르트 굳
망고잼 노
역시
내 취향이지만
모르겠다
^~*
🫧 인위적인데 인위적이지 않은 맛을 좋아하구나..

으응..
🫧 약간 공장이랑 자연이 섞인 맛???

ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
말린 망고도 딱히
근데 또 건조딸기는
맛있어
..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
웨이브는 먹고싶은 거 먹어 그냥..
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 우린 항상 먹고 싶은 거 먹지

아 그래?
아무래도
그렇지..?
웅..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 너의 사랑을 먹고있ㅇ 

ㄱㄱㄱㄱ고마워
허허
헉

But recently,
though it’s already fall,
it’s been so hot,
so I was craving something cool.
So I drank a strawberry latte I hadn’t had in ages.
!!!!
🍓🥛😚😚😚
It was as delicious as ever.
Phew.
And today…
I ate strawberry bingsu with Hayeon unnie.
Wow,
it was so delicious.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Hehe
It was really tasty.
🫧 Can I ask why you like strawberry lattes but not strawberry milk???

Strawberry milk has
kind of an artificial taste to it.
I don’t really like strawberry ice cream either.
Ah, but banana milk is artificial yet tasty.
I guess it’s just my preference. ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Have you tried strawberry-banana or chocolate-banana?

Chocolate-banana is
really good.
I drank it when I was in elementary school and haven’t since,
but it’s still good.
It’s just
sweet + sweet.
The combined sweetness of chocolate and banana……
🫧 Do you like mango, Bini?

Mangoes…
I only like the juice.
Hmm,
that’s kind of odd too.
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Frozen mango, fresh mango, no.
Apple mango, good.
Mango juice, mango yogurt, good.
Mango jam, no.
Again,
it’s just my preference, but
I don’t know.
^~*
🫧 You like things that are artificial but not too artificial...

Yup..
🫧 Like a mix between factory-made and natural flavors?

ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Dried mangoes, not really.
But dried strawberries
are delicious.
..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
WAV, just eat whatever you want...
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 We always eat whatever we want.

Oh, really?
I guess...
That’s true, right?
Yeah...
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I'm eating your love. 

ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Thanks.
Hehe
Gasp
