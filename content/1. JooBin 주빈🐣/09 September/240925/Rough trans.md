JooBin's tent remains a mystery 

#JooBin #주빈


🫧 Binnie, what was that thing labeled "Binnie" in the fridge?

I washed some blueberries and stored them
I washed them thoroughly
Maybe that's why they weren't thrown away
They were just left there
Phew
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Was most of your stuff in the fridge not thrown out?

They cleaned everything for me
A lot of things seem out of place 
but most of it stayed where it was
💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺
Ah, the really unfortunate thing is
it was filmed before I set up my tent 
so I couldn’t show it to you
ㅜㅡㅜ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
If I had shown you the tent
it’s so cozy you might have fallen asleep
it's that comfortable
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 No wonder I saw SooMin’s curtain in the room but couldn’t find the tent even after searching everywhereㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋExactly
The very next day after filming
I set it up
But really, they cleaned everything so wellㅜㅜㅜㅜ
The house was spotless
and I was in shock when I walked in
The members and I were like
“Huh.!!!!!!”
🫧 Was it really that bad?<sup>[EN]</sup>

It wasn’t that bad but after the cleaning they did
It was waaay cleaner
They're the best
🤍🤍🤍🤍
The members who helped must’ve been exhausted
I’m so thankful to all of them
They’re the best, seriously…
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Let’s express our loveㅋㅋ

Thank you love you 🫶🏻

JooBin doesn’t play Minecraft or rather, can’t

#JooBin #주빈


🫧 I suddenly got curious. JooBin, do you play Minecraft too?

No, I can't play games
I’m really not cut out for it
I’m not skilled either
I just can't do it
So I don’t play
I'm the type of person who doesn’t play because I’m bad at games and don’t enjoy them
It’s me! <sup>[EN]</sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You'll get better if you keep playing

The process of getting better while playing
I don’t agree with that
🫧 Are you sure it's not that you're bad at it, but that you just don’t find it interesting?ㅎㅎ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋI guess so
Maybe that’s right
It’s just not something I find enjoyable
🫧 My ideal type is someone who’s bad at games

Assa! ㅋ <sup>[t/n: Oh yeah]</sup>
🫧 Adding to Binnie’s “can’t do” list:
1. Cooking <sup>[t/n: Well... let’s just say JooBin isn’t exactly the best at cooking 🫢]</sup>
2. Sports <sup>[t/n: because of ISAC..]</sup>
3. Playing Games - New!

You don’t have to add that
🫧 My ideal type is JooBin

I already knew that
^~*
