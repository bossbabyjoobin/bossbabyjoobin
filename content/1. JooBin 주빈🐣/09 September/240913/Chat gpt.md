I'm here  
I ran over  
😉🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺  
🫧 What is Bini doing?

Listening to music with Seon-unnie  
Sion-unnie is going to teach me some exercises  
Wait a second  
ㅓㅏㅏㅇ  
어ㅜㅜㅎ  
I just finished stretching  
It feels refreshing  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Out of nowhere  
She handed me her phone and said  
"Bina, do you want to try this?"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
ㅇ오 웅  
And then we started right away  
🫧 I’m so excited for the showcase that I can't sleep 🥺

Go to sleep alreadyㅏ  
While listening to "Do It Do It"?  
ㅎㅎ  
But if I listen to "Do It," I can't sleep  
"Do It Do It Do It Dooool"  
It's a beat that makes you move  
Doom-chit doom-chit  
🕺💃🕺💃  
🫧 I’m going to dance in my dreams

🕺💃🕺💃🕺✨🕺✨  
🫧 I was listening to "Do It Do It" on the bus earlier, and I started bobbing my head without realizing it..

ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  
Today, or actually yesterday  
I ate meat  
Steak  
I ate it with salad 😲😲😲😲  
🫧 Where’s mine??? Why didn’t you include me?

You didn’t show up, so  
I ate it all...  
ㅎ  
I’ll recommend something for tomorrow  
Udon  
Sounds good, right?  
Fried tofu udon  
How about that?  
🫧 Why are you so cute?

What’s this, a sudden flirtation.  
Did you think it’d work?  
If so  
Yeah, thanks ^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bini, you’re not an easy woman ㄷㄷㄷ

A little bit?  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I'm so excited to go to Japan right now  
Honestly, my eyes are sleepy  
But my heart is happy  
That kind of feeling  
🫧 Are you smiling with your eyes closed? Because that’s me right now

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋAh  
[Y/N], you can sleep  
I’ll leave it here  
See you tomorrow  
🫧 But what if Bini already woke me up while I was sleeping?

… I don’t know about that  
ㅋ  
🫧 While packing, did you forget anything?

🥕  
We talked about it earlier in the car  
With the members  
“Did you finish packing your bags?”  
I haven’t yet  
But I’ve already packed  
Conversations like that  
🫧 I heard there’s someone who still hasn’t packed ㅋㅋㅋ

Quite the spontaneous member...  
When we go to Japan  
I’m going to eat delicious things  
So for the past few days  
I’ve been eating less delicious stuff  
I’ll eat all the bread there  
🥖🍞🥪🥯🥐🥨  
🫧 I can’t wait to see you in Japan 🥺

Me too🤍🤍😚😚  
I’ll fly over as soon as I can  
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️  
Oh right  
I changed my cat phone case  
Now it’s a new one  
When I take mirror selfies,  
You’ll see light pink  
💗  
🫧 You’ll show us with a selfie soon, right?

I’ll think about it for now ㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Bini, did you really grow 5 cm in 10 months?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
On Signal, I said it really fast  
I’m not sure if it was 10 months  
Uwaaaangㅇ아아ㅏ아ㅏㅇ  
I’m sleepy  
I’m talking with Sion-unnie  
About bread  
And ice cream  
There’s a new flavor  
Dubai chocolate ice cream  
So we said we have to try it later  
Conversations like that..  
^~^~^~^  
🫧 If you two were roommates, you'd probably buy out an entire convenience store

No way, not happening then
Every night Sion-unnie  
Would take bread out of the fridge and say  
"Bina... Just take one bite??  
"It’s seriously so deliciousㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠ🥹🥹🥹"  
And that’s how you gain weight  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
But I bet we’d enjoy some delicious days together...  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
Now I’m going to talk with ShiOn unnie and then sleep  
 Good night  
😚😚😚😚😚  
It’s late  
Sleep well  
See you tomorrow!!!  
🤍
