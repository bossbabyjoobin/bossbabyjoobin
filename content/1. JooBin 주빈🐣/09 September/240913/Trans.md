JooBin spent the night with ShiOn
Can you guess what they did and talked about? 

#JooBin #주빈


`[VM: Hi WAV]`
I'm here  
I came here running   
😉🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺  
🫧 What are you doing Binnie?

Listening to music with ShiOn unnie  
ShiOn unnie is going to teach me some exercises  
Wait a second  
`[After 2 minutes...]` 
I did some stretching  
It feels refreshing  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Out of nowhere  
ShiOn unnie handed me her phone and said  
"Bin-ah, do you want to try this?"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I said yes and then we started right away  
🫧 I’m so excited for the showcase that I can't sleep 🥺

Go to sleep already
While listening to Do It Do It?  <sup>[Fun Fact: NXT members call Just Do It ➡ Do It]</sup>
ㅎㅎ  
But if you listen to Do It, you can't sleep  
Do It Do It Do It Do it all  
It's a beat that makes you move  
🕺💃🕺💃  
🫧 I’m going to dance in my dreams

🕺💃🕺💃🕺✨🕺✨  
🫧 I was listening to Do It Do It on the bus earlier, and I started bobbing my head without realizing it..

ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  
Today
Ah actually yesterday  <sup>[t/n: it's 01:21 AM that time] </sup>
I ate meat, it's steak  
I had it with salad 😲😲😲😲  
🫧 Where’s mine??? Why didn’t you include me?

You didn’t show up, so I ate it all...  
ㅎ  
I’ll recommend something for tomorrow  
Udon  
Sounds good, right?  
Fried tofu udon  
How about that?  
🫧 Why are you so cute?

What’s this? You're suddenly flirting with me
Did you think it will work?  
If so  
Yeah, thanks ^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie, you’re not an easy girl

A little bit?  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I'm so excited to go to Japan right now  
My eyes are closing because I'm sleepy
But my heart is happy  
That kind of feeling  
🫧 Are you smiling with your eyes closed? Because that’s me right now

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋAh  
[Y/N] you can sleep  
🫧 But what if Binnie already woke me up while I was sleeping?

… I don’t know about that  
ㅋ  
🫧 While packing, did you not forget anything?

🥕  <sup>[**당근** Danggeun = 🥕, slang for 당연하지 (Of course)]</sup>
We even talked about it earlier in the car with the members
“Did you finish packing your bags?”  
"I haven’t yet" 
"I'm already done packing"  
Conversations like that  
🫧 I heard there’s someone who still hasn’t packed ㅋㅋㅋ

Quite an impulsive member...  
When we go to Japan  
I’m going to eat delicious things  
So for the past few days  
I’ve been eating less delicious stuff  
I’ll eat all the bread there  
🥖🍞🥪🥯🥐🥨  
🫧 I can’t wait to see you in Japan 🥺

Me too🤍🤍😚😚  
I’ll fly over as soon as I can  
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️  
Oh right  
I changed my cat phone case  
Now it’s a light pink case
When I take mirror selfies,  you'll see it
💗  
🫧 You're going to send one soon, right?

I’ll think about it first ㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Binnie, did you really grow 5 cm in 10 months?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
On SIGNAL, I said it really fast  
I’m not sure if it was 10 months  
I’m sleepy  
I’m talking with ShiOn unnie about bread and ice cream  
There’s a new flavor  
Dubai chocolate ice cream  
So we said we have to try it later  
^~^~^~^  
🫧 If you two were roommates, I think you would probably end up buying the entire convenience store

No, we can't do that
Every night, ShiOn unnie would take bread out of the fridge and say  
"Bin-ah...do you want to take a bite??"
"It’s sooo tastyㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠ🥹🥹🥹"  
And that’s how you gain weight  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
But I have a feeling we would be enjoying a lot of good food...
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
Now I’m going to talk with ShiOn unnie and then sleep  
Goodnight  
😚😚😚😚😚  
It’s late  
Sleep well  
See you tomorrow!!!  
🤍
`[VM: Bye! Good night ~]`
`[VM: Bye! I love you ~]`
