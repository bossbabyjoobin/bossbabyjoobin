Hehe  
A day when I heard a hundred times that I looked like a brown Maltese + Poodle  
✨✨✨🐶  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Key  
The truth behind that photo is,  
I was so tired that I was sitting there with this expression 🙂,  
Then suddenly I saw a camera from afar  
And started waving the V-sign like this 😊😊😊😊😊  
That’s how the photo came out

Heh  
Right now,  
I've made cookies twice today  
I'm currently making cookies  
They’re almond cookies,  
I gave them to my younger siblings to try  
First review: It kinda tastes like pumpkin..? The aftertaste is slightly bitter  
Second review: (nom) I don’t want to eat this  
(nom) But I ate it all  
After my sibling ate it all during the second review, I asked,  
"How was it??!"  
Then they said,  
"Unnie! I think you should try something different next time."  
They said it so innocently  
That it made me feel even more sorry...  
But honestly,  
To me,  
They were really tasty  
I swear they were good  
🫧 People say that what you make yourself always tastes good

Ah  
ㅎㅎ  
But really,  
This one's not bad  
The first 100 WAVs to arrive can have it for free  
Come eat it! ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
😋😋😋  
I'm telling you, it's really good💖  
I'm making them right now too  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
VM1  
Considering it's a diet recipe,  
It's actually  
Tasty  
Or maybe because I had it after eating salad, it tastes even better...?  
But it's seriously good  
It's just pure almond flour  
All it tastes like is roasted, sweet almonds  
🫧 My sibling probably didn’t take into account that it’s diet food

I didn’t tell them, actually  
Maybe that’s why...  
🫧 But it is a cookie, so it's kinda sad that there are no chocolate chips

Even my sibling asked,  
"Is this a recipe that doesn't allow chocolate chips??"  
So I just said,  
"Just eat it."  
^~^~^~^~^  
My mistake ㅎㅎ  
Oh well, can't help it ㅎ  
🫧 Binnie, I miss you

Me too  
I’ll bring almond cookies with me  
Let's meet up  
🫧 Binnie.... stop cooking....😞😞😞

Don’t block the future of an aspiring chef!  
ㅋ  
🫧 Let’s just meet without cookies…ㅎㅎ

I’m bringing cookies  
No refusals allowed  
^~*  
Next batch of cookies will be done in 2 minutes  
ㅎㅎㅎ Hehe  
Yay  
Yay 1 minute  
🫧 Uh oh, I’m looking for the next victim! ㄷㄷ

Ehey  
It’s a gift  
🎁🎁🎁🎁  
🫧 Binnie, my friend wants to try your cookies

Recruit them into WAV  
I'll give them lots of cookies  
10 seconds left  
I'll go grab them, brb!! ㅎ  
Woonwaangaaaa  
It smells so delicious and nutty  
I’ll send them to the fridge now  
Perfect✨✨✨✨✨✨  
🫧 Our Binnie is good at making anything^^ Hohoho

Thank youㅎㅎ  
Before I go to bed later,  
Remind me to put the cookies in the fridge  
They’re cooling down right now  
Oh, earlier,  
Hayeon-unnie said she was bored being by herself  
So she came to our house and  
Lay on the sofa the whole time,  
Then when she saw me washing tomatoes,  
She went, "Hmm.. I want to eat tomatoes ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ"  
I asked, "Will 10 be enough?"  
Wungㅎㅎ Hehe  
So I washed them and gave them to her  
She said they were delicious and ate them all before leaving  
Oh, before going,  
She also ate Seollin-unnie's Shine Muscat grapes  
🫧 Guess she wasn’t bored, just hungry??

Ah, so that’s what it was  
I got fooled...  
🫧 So what’s the name of your room?

SeolBingSooJi  
I made it up myself  
🫧 What are your roles in the room?

Soomin-unnie holds a concert,  
The rest of us live normal lives  
🫧 But do you actually call each other by the room name?

We just created it  
And that’s it  
ㅎㅎ  
I’m the exhausted audience who cheers too much at the concert  
Seollin-unnie blocks the noise with her AirPods,  
And Jiyeon-unnie leaves the room to sit in the living room  
🫧 It’s really Soomin's solo concert just for Binnie

…Actually, I like it!  
🫧 I’m jealous, is there an empty bed in the room?

ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Nope  
Should I give you mine?  
🫧 No, you go sleep..

Nyepp  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I almost moved my bed to the sofa  
🫧 But can you actually sleep in that room?

It's quiet when we sleep
🫧 Are you a light sleeper or a heavy sleeper, Binnie?

Honestly, I used to be someone who wouldn’t even wake up if there was a fire, no joke. But since moving into the house, I’ve become super sensitive. I guess I’ve adapted…
🫧 Were you more on edge at first?

At the beginning, yeah. Now, I don’t even realize I’m tense, but I just hear everything.
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 But now you’ve got the tent, right?

Oh, right! The tent does help with the first layer of soundproofing, so it’s not too bad.
My cookies must smell amazing! ShinWi and JiYeon caught a whiff and were like, “Who’s cooking?! This smells delicious~~~ ㅠㅠ.”
🫧 Wait, were you doing it secretly this whole time?

No, everyone was just in their rooms, so they had no idea.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Did any of the members eat your cookies yet?

Not yet, hehe. I’ll share them later and give you some feedback!
🫧 How long do you usually cool cookies for?

I’ve never made regular cookies, so I’m not sure, but I’m letting mine cool for about 30 minutes. If I put them in the fridge, they get chewy.
🫧 Did you eyeball it again this time?

Busted. ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
I just went with, “This dough seems like the right consistency,” and made them, but they turned out fine!
🫧 Do you prefer crispy or chewy cookies?

Definitely chewy! Crispy ones are too dry. I like cookies that are a bit moist.
🫧 What if you soaked them in water? Would that help?

Why water?! You have to dip cookies in milk!
🫧 You’re a true cookie connoisseur, Binnie.

Arigato.
🫧 How long do you dunk them in milk?

For Oreos, it’s a solid 3 seconds—like this: “Oooooone, twoooo, threeee.” For cookies, it's more like 2 seconds: “Oooooone, twoooo.” That’s the sweet spot.
I’ve put them in the fridge now!
🫧 Do you like your cereal soggy or crunchy?

Crunchy. The only exception is **Czech** for when I’m just trying to get the leftover chocolate milk.
🫧 So you don’t like **Choripong latte**?

I do like it, though.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Do you like pistachios?

Yeah! I love them. So whenever a new pistachio flavor comes out, Sion-unnie will be like, “Bina!!!! New pistachio!!!” and I’m like, “Omg, I saw it!”
🫧 Without food and exercise, ShoNi has nothing left, huh?

That’s spot on.  
And oh, remember how Soomin-unnie made the same cookies as me? Chaewon-unnie just came by to eat some, and her review wasn’t great. It was something like, “Is this okay to eat? Is it expired? This isn’t right.” Soomin-unnie’s like, “No, they’re diet cookies. I worked hard on them. Eat it.”
The conclusion was that you need to keep in mind they’re diet cookies to appreciate them.
All I could hear outside was “Yaa!!! Yaaaa!!!”
🫧 Binna, let’s have a cookie exchange with Soomin. Let's go!

The recipes are the same, so the exchange would be meaningless…
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Maybe you’re just hearing more noise now, not that you’re a lighter sleeper?

Now that I think about it, you’re right.
🫧 No way your cookies and hers are the same. You didn’t follow the recipe exactly.

Then mine must taste better.
^~^
🫧 Confidence approved.

Thank you. ㅎㅎ
🫧 Where’s this confidence even coming from?

I’ve got a good reason. It’s my cute storage container. It looks so adorable, it tricks you into thinking the cookies taste even better. Like a visual illusion.
✨🍪✨
ㅎ
🫧 Is it a character container?

Yep, it’s a cute little bear container. Now I’m gonna go become one with my bed. But before that, it’s too late for **today’s meal recommendation (야메추)**, so I’ll do **tomorrow’s (낼메추)** instead. Tomorrow’s meal is almond cookies and **galbijjim**!
🫧 Ah, sorry. I’m not so sure about that.
VM
🫧 Galbijjim followed by dessert?

Exactly.
🫧 How about kimchi jjim?

Okay, anything jjim works.
🫧 You weren’t planning to dip cookies into galbijjim, were you?

If you want to, go ahead. I wouldn’t, but hey, if that’s what WAV wants, why not?
🫧 I want to dip JooBin.

.. Thank you.  
I’ll go to bed now………  
Goodnight.
