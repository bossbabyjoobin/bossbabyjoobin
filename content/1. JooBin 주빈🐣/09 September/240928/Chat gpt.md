Here's a casual translation:

Whaaaaattttt
[Y/N], what are you doing?
ㅎㅎ
Iiiii
packed my lunch for tomorrow~
Removed my nails, so there might be typos
^~*
The lunch menu is
Inari sushi!!!!
I made it perfectly, while getting worried glances from TuSeoyeon unnie,
and Jiyun unnie was just 😶 staring,
while Seoyeon unnie was like, "Bin-ah, don't you have to do it this way?? I think you should do it like this."
After all that worry,
I finally did it!
I made it!!!!
For real
It's sincerely
pretty
inari sushi~
Nom
Nom
🫧 Even if it were me... I'd be so worried that one of the 23rd of 24 kids born in '09 is making inari sushi for tomorrow that I wouldn't even be able to sleep.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Honestly, I did sneak a few bites while making them.

When you make inari sushi, you’re supposed to eat the ones that get messed up.
Sadly, since it's nighttime,
I saved everything for my lunch tomorrow~
There wasn’t even a single one that got messed up~~
ㅋ
Later, I’ll show my almond cookies and inari sushi,
along with my egg rolls,
and brag about it on Signal.
Ta-da!!
How do they look?
Uhahaha~
🫧 There are no pictures?? You’d think you'd take a photo to capture the moment of success.

I took some,
but it feels a bit much to send them all at once,
so I'll substitute it with this!
![[GYfl3WvbAAAe3OR.jpg|150]]
Isn’t this fine?
ㅎㅅㅎ
A pic I took on the day we filmed "Musinsa Sends" because I liked the beret ✌️
🫧 Oh my, who’s this cutie? Oh, it's Binnie.

😉
🫧 The sesame on top gives that inari sushi vibe in the pic.

Oh, does that mean it looks pretty?
Got it~
Thanks 🫶🏻
But I think the Kangol bag is super cute.
It's round but also square-ish~
I have it,
and it's so cute.
🫧 Cuter than you?

Yup ㅎ
That bag is way tinier~~~
🫧 Has Binnie grown taller by any chance?

Eh,
probably not.
Lack of sleep these days
seems to have stopped my growth.
What to do~
🫧 Nah, it’s genetics, that’s just an excuse.

Genes won’t cut it!
You have to sleep and eat well!!!
🫧 Even if you sleep and eat well, it doesn't always work.

You didn't drink your milk, did you?
🫧 So, are you satisfied with your current height?

Still
not enough.
^~*
🫧 Is your goal Jiwoo unnie or Nien unnie?

Hmm,
Jiwoo unnie~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Did you see Wuseul?

Man,
there’s so many!!
Because of my intermittent fasting,
I’m fine~~~~~
Do you want to stop right now?!?!
I thought you were going to say your arm hurt again like last time~~~~
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Did you memorize all that already?

ㅋ
It's me,
Triple Wuseul.
I even saw Yeoreum unnie acting with the hat.
ㅎㅎ
Thinking about it,
even back in high school.
ㅎㅎ
🫧 I want to see Binnie showing off cooking skills(?) on "Three Person's Table!"

I actually told the content team about it.
Where did my Signal go?????? Where???? Aren’t you curious about my cooking???
They said okay.
So they asked what dish I’d like to make,
and I said stir-fried pork belly!
…That’s going to be hard, isn’t it?
Well, it’s hard, so that’s why I’ll do it. ㅎ
How about inari sushi..??
Inari sushi is too easy!!! I can make it with my eyes closed!!!
So we still haven’t decided on the menu yet.
I’ve never made stir-fried pork belly before,
but I told them with full confidence.
^~^~^~^
I’m now
the master of inari sushi.
🫧 How about egg sushi next time?

Egg sushi isn't really my style~
It’s off the candidate list.
I’ve been watching way too many cooking videos lately,
so I'm pretty much channeling a chef.
;;;;
I watch them while
overestimating my own skills.
;;;;;;
The problem is, I’ve only watched and haven’t actually made anything…
But it's fun to imagine my… skills…
🫧 Too bad, egg sushi didn’t make the cut.

Ugh,
why??
Why not?!
What’s wrong with my almond cookies!!
I made the choco jam perfectly!!
🫧 They weren’t evenly cooked.

…You got me.
🫧 The almond tasted like pumpkin, though, so you're approved.

? Isn’t this some random biased judging?
Even I think this is a bit...
awkward...
🫧 I can't remember, what was the choco jam originally supposed to be?

Ah, it was that.
I was making choco jam, and it turned out perfectly.
Actually, it was supposed to be a choco cake, like a fudgy brownie~
But if you spread it like jam,
it becomes fudge.
It’s the same thing.
I just suddenly wanted to eat jam.
You get it, right?
^~^
Let me give you a meal suggestion for tomorrow.
Alright, tomorrow's meal suggestion iiiissss
steak salad!!!!!
I’ve been eating this for two days straight,
and it’s so good.
Of course, I change up the ingredients,
so I don’t get tired of it.
But it’s so tasty.
🫧 Can you eat the same thing if it’s good?

…Nope, ㅎ
I get tired of it.
I can’t eat the same thing more than three times a week.
But I can eat bread more than three times…
It's like
kalguksu or fried rice,
those kinds of rice dishes.
They get boring,
so you have to keep switching up the menu.
……
Sorry, had to move the laundry.
……………
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I was going to sleep, but
the laundry finished, so I figured I’d fold it and then say goodnight.
But then I thought I should take it out first,
and I ended up doing all the folding too.
…..
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 You came back pretty fast for having folded everything?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
My bad ㅎㅎ
___
Let me teach you a new kind of flirting.
I just remembered it.
Listen up.
First, wash your hands,
then apply some nice-smelling hand cream on your dry hands.
Put on a lot.
Then go up to the person you’re flirting with
and wave your hands super fast in front of them,
like you’re making them think, "What is this?"
Swish swish swish!
Then,
😉 ㅎ
give them a smile like this.
Walk away without looking back.
Then they’ll start thinking, "What was that?" and "What was that nice smell?"
It’ll stick in their mind.
They won’t be able to stop thinking about it,
and eventually, they’ll come up and ask,
"Hey, what was that scent?"
😉🌸🌸🌸 Success!
This is a flirting technique I came up with myself.
It works 100%.
I’ve already tested it on our members.
Seoyeon unnie, Kaeun unnie, Tona unnie, Jiyeon unnie, Lin unnie, Chaewon unnie, etc.
More than half of them got flirted with using my hand cream scent.
And the result?
Perfect success. ㅎ
🫧 Jiyeon unnie is leaving a serious quote in her From while you’re here teaching us a flirting technique, it’s confusing…

Jiyeon unnie, enjoy your food~
She was drinking something that looked like strawberry yogurt.
The hand cream flirting even worked on Jiyeon unnie who was drinking strawberry yogurt.
ㅎ
I’m amazing.
🫧 Where did you learn to flirt like this, Binnie?

I came up with it myself,
using my brain.
Isn’t it clever?
It’s 100% practical,
with a 100% success rate.
Awesome, right?
🫧 I’ll try it next time and let you know how it goes.

Finally, my first WAVE that’s on board.
^~^
As soon as I put on the hand cream,
everyone’s like,
"Huh?" and looks at me.
It leaves a lingering effect. ㅎ
🫧 If you do that to someone you don't know, won’t they report you?

…? Probably best not to try it on strangers.
Might be a bit risky…
🫧 I’m curious about what scent you used, Binnie… I’m tempted now.
The scent that enchanted so many people.

ㅎ
It’s my top-secret recipe.
Wait a sec, I'll go check.
It's a mix of lime basil
and mandarin.
Lime basil & mandarin.
🫧 I wish there was something like a voice message but with scent. That’d be great.

That’s such a cool idea.
Yeah, that light yellow hand cream.
Ah, I’m hungryㅠ
When you're hungry,
you should sleep.
So,
I’m going to bed now.
😚


Bye, everyone!
