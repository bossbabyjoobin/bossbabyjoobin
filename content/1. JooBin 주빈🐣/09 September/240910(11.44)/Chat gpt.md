Surprised JooBin  
🫢  
Hehe  
By the way, the marine look photos were uploaded today  
I really like it  
💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺  

Actually, for those marine look photos  
I spent 20 minutes just thinking about the caption  
Eventually, I was like, “Whatever, just move on~ haha”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
What were the options again?  
Something like, “The weather’s good.”  
There were other things too  
Anyway, I just said to move on  
Even though I just blurted it out  

^~^  
🫧 Wow!! You're kinda cute!!!  

Thanks!! Hehe  
🫧 What did you eat today?  

I had beef chuck salad with Mayu unnie  
Yum yum  
🫧 What did you do today?  

Today, I went to school, practiced, ate, worked out, and packed my bags  
🫧 No mention of WAV thought…  

I thought about WAV a million, no, a billion times hehe  
![[240910_11PM_3.m4a]]  
It was a bit early.  
What do you mean?  
I came to talk to Soomin unnie about something  
🫧 This Saturday is your Japan showcase, and next week, it’s already Chuseok  
Time flies so fast 🫠🫠🫠  

Ughhh  
For Chuseok  
You have to!!!  
Have to have tteok (rice cake)  
Remember that  
[Y/N] Got it??  
🫧 How about a Chuseok vlog?  

I actually want to film it  
But I’m worried it'll just be a time-lapse of me lying down all day…  
What do you think…  
I’m thinking of filming it  
I'll just do it and see  
🫧 How many songpyeon will you eat for Chuseok?!!  

A hundred!!!!!!  
🫧 I’ll eat a thousand!!!!!!!  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What’s your favorite type of tteok?  

Honey tteok, wind tteok, black sesame tteok, injeolmi, songpyeon, gyeongdan… there are too many!  
When it comes to tteok and bread,  
I can’t really answer  
Though it’s the same for other things too hehe  
🫧 Random question, but plain dumpling soup vs. rice cake dumpling soup?  

Definitely rice cake dumpling soup  
With plain dumpling soup,  
You only have dumplings,  
But with rice cake dumpling soup,  
You get everything, right??  
Of course, I’d eat it all  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I saw the photos from your photoshoot  

Hehe  
A different  
Makeup  
Concept  
They even drew freckles  
Oh wow, is this me…???  
Well, not exactly, but that kind of feeling  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I took a lot of pictures~~~~  
But I need time to organize them  
Thank you for waiting, hamster-ramen  
🫧 What about YeonJi behavior?  

I tried copying Sion unnie  
Sion unnie always says  
"Thank you, hamster-ramen"  
She even says it during practice  
At first, I was like,  
“Oh, that’s just her personality..!”  
But later, it started to annoy me  
🤍🤍🤍  
Next, they like to annoy each other a lot  
But when things get tough, they’re so  
We can do this!!!! 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹  
There’s no middle ground  
^~^~^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But it’s fun, so it’s okay  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 That’s how it is when you're really close  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ You’re right  
I think it’s because we’re the closest and most comfortable  
🫧 I really miss you, Bini 🥺🥺🥺  

Me too 🥹🤍🤍  
🫧 I’m waiting to see you at the showcase  

Oh my gosh, it’s already past midnight  
It’s the day after tomorrow!!!!  
We’ll see each other soon 😚😚  
I’m not nervous right now,  
But I might start feeling nervous during the rehearsal…  
And right before the stage, I’ll probably go “Aaaahhh!!!”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Find the fan with your name on it, please ㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

Okay!!  
🫧 The showcase must be exciting ㅋㅋ  

My second showcase!!  
And  
My first showcase in Japan!!!!  
I’m looking forward to it  
😉  
🫧 How excited should we be??  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Did you prepare your greeting or are you still Baby JooBin? ㅋㅋ  

That’s right  
Maybe BossBabyBin??  
I’ll ask Lin unnie later  
It’s a secret for now  
I haven’t decided yet, but  
Wooahh  
I need to pack  
But I’ll probably keep packing tomorrow too  
I’ll get 60% done  
🫧 But you’ve been packing for 3 days…?  

Well,  
I pick my clothes,  
Separate lotions and repack them  
When you add all that up  
It’s just an excuse  
There are things I still need until tomorrow,  
So I can’t put them in yet  
I’ll just organize for now  
And pack my clothes  
ㅎㅎ  
I’m off to pack  
Say hi to Jiyeon unnie for me  
Time to pack  
I haven’t seen Jiyeon unnie in a while  
We share the same room  
..ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Our schedules didn’t overlap much  
So I’m gonna go see Jiyeon unnie  
Bye
