JooBin being normal by tripleS standards but then....

#JooBin #주빈


🫧 Nien said Binnie seems the most **normal** in tripleS. Do you agree with that?

Yes  
I totally agree  
🫧 Why??

Why, you ask?  
You can see it (It's obvious)
!  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 By tripleS standards ㅎㅎ<sup>        [t/n: Binnie is **normal** compared to her unnies, yes]</sup>

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Today, I took some pictures of Lynn unnie  
They turned out so well  
I was shocked  
I really like them
ㅎ  
So cute!!!!!

🫧 How was Lynn's long hair?

During the pick-up, Lynn unnie and I just looked at each other  
For three seconds  
ㅇㅅㅇ...  
With this expression  
And then I realized “Oh, it’s Lynn unnie”  
Lynn unnie with long hair
She hadn’t slept at all  
We both saw each other early in the morning  
So we were both like  
ㅇㅇ...  
With those eyes  
After I came to my senses 
I was like “Oh!!! Unnie, you’ve got long hair now!”  
That’s what happened  
Today, due to lack of sleep  
I got super hyper and said this to YeonJi unnie  
Jeongsin cheri🍒_(정신 체리)_ <sup>[OG KR:정신 **차려** _(jeongsin charyeo)_ = get/pull yourself together]</sup>
<sup>[It's like: Let us pray > Lettuce pray ^~^ in english] <sup>(Get it?)</sup></sup>
I said it to her like 20 times
Jeongsin cheri!!!
🫧 Wow… I bet the mood around you froze up  

YeonJi unnie likes it
"ㅋIt's not funny Binnie"
She said that while laughing
^~*  
🫧 YeonJi’s always laughing though

No matter what you say, she’s always laughing...  
🫧 I’m jealous that Binnie has an unnie like YeonJi  

How is it?
Having an unnie who laughs at anything you say?  
How does that sound?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
