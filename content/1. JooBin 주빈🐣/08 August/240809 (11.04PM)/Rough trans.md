🫧 코토네와의 일본어 수업은 어떻게 되고 있어

아니 내가 그냥 뜻을 모르고 일단 따라하거든?
일본즈 언니들이 대화할 때
머리머라 하면 오 똑같이 말하고
그러고 뜻을 물어보는데
자꾸 토네언니가 뭘 알려주길래
살짝 이상한데
일단 따라했단 말이야
옆에서 언니들이 그런 거 왜 알려주냐 이러고
? 뭔 뜻인데ㅔ??
린언니가
옛날밈 좀 그만 알려주래
그제서야 깨달은
언니들이 나한테 시키고 웃던 이유
아—!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
그냥 유행 지난 밈을
하나씩 알려줘써 ㅎㅎㅎ
놀리기 좋은 상
^~^~^~^

Kotone trolls JooBin with old Japanese memes

#JooBin #주빈


🫧 How are your Japanese lessons with Kotone going so far?

I was just repeating things without knowing the meaning, right?  
When the Japanese members were talking
I’d hear something and go “Oh!” and repeat it exactly the same way 
Then I’d ask them what it meant
but Kotone unnie kept teaching me things  
so I thought it was a bit weird but I just went along with it 
Then, the other members beside me were like  
“Why are you teaching her that?”  
I was like “? What does it mean??”  
Then Lynn unnie said "Stop teaching her old memes"  
That’s when I finally realized why the unnies were making me say things and laughing  
Ah—!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
They were just teaching me outdated memes one by one ㅎㅎㅎ 
I’m an easy target to tease  
^~^~^~^
