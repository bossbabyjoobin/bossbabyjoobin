🫧 시온 데리고 와서 골라 당장.

시온언니랑 빵 얘기하면
진짜 장난 아니고
3시간 넘게
할 수 있어
조심해야대……..
저번엔 또
나랑 서아랑 시온언니랑 있는데
서아가 무슨 초코케이크를 시켰다
이 얘기를 하다가
시온언니가 같은 방이니까 서아가 시킨 걸 알고 있어서
아니야 그거 케이크 아니고 푸딩이야
서아가 다시 아니 그거 케이크래
시온언니가 아니 그건 케이크일 수가 없어
푸딩이라고
이래서 서아가
아니 거기 가게에 케이크라 써있었어
시온언니가 그치만 그건 푸딩이야
브레드푸딩!!!! 그건 케이크가 아니야
푸딩이라고
그걸 케이크라고 하면 안돼
서아가 듣고 ..가게에 그렇게 써있어서….
이걸 들으면서
난 옆에서
그 가게에 찾아가서
죄송한데 한 번만 푸딩 맞다고 해주실 수 있을까요
라고 여쭤보고 싶었어……….
휴……..

JooBin is so over it after hearing SeoAh and ShiOn argue over a cake — or is it really a cake? 

#JooBin #주빈
<BR>
`[JooBin was talking about bread before this because a WAV suggested that she should try Melon Bread once she's in Japan...]`

🫧 Then what’s your favorite bread, Binnie? ㅎㅎ

I don’t think I can ever choose…  

🫧 Bring ShiOn over and pick one right now

When you talk about bread with ShiOn unnie  
It's no joke 
She can go on for over three hours
You need to be careful...  
Last time, It was me, SeoAh and ShiOn unnie  
SeoAh ordered some kind of chocolate cake  
We were talking about it  
ShiOn unnie knew what SeoAh ordered since they were roommates
She said "No, that's not cake. It's pudding"  
SeoAh responded "No, they said it was a cake"  
ShiOn unnie argued "There's no way that's a cake. It's pudding"  
SeoAh said "But the store labeled it as cake"  
ShiOn unnie replied "But it's pudding. It's bread pudding!!! It's not cake" 
"You cannot call that a cake"  
SeoAh heard that and said "But the store wrote it as cake...."  
Listening to this, I wanted to go to that store and ask  
"Excuse me, can you just say it's pudding for once?"  
\*Sigh*

Binnie made a guess about who her roommate in Japan could be + a very random Sullin

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 Has your roommate already been decided?

Oh right  
I don’t know yet
Who could it be?  
Let me guess
Based on my feeling…  
Hmm…  
<sup>[SoYeon, JiWoo, **SooMin**, NaKyoung DaHyun ,Kotone, YeonJi, Xinyu, Lynn, **JooBin**, ChaeWon, JiYeon]</sup>
I’m the third one from the back
So it might be the third member from the front
SooMin unnie...?  
Or  
Lynn unnie?  
Or  
JiYeon unnie?  
I think it's one of the three
If I’m right 
I’m a geniusㅎ
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I’ll tell you tomorrow 
Sullin unnie drank cocoa  
The cocoa scent reached all the way here <sup>[in their room]</sup>
Sullin unnie came into our room and said
"Mmm ~~~~~~ "  
"It smells nice"
Then she left
