[Y/N] !!!!
Come out!!!!!!!
Long time no see
What have you been up to
🫧 Just finished getting ready and now I'm just lying around

Wondering what I'm thinking..?
;;;;;;;;;;;;;
🫧 I missed you so much, I ordered chicken

Doesn't matter.
🫧 I want to see you right now

🥹 Me too  
This time  
I have so much  
I really want to talk to you about  
Phew  
It was so good..  
I got obsessed with Japan……
🫧 Did you go to Don Quijote???

Yeah 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹  
I was like "Omg!!" as I went in  
But then I got lost  
And surrounded by all these unknown words  
It was a bit scary  
But then, bam!  
I met Jiu unnie..  
ㅎㅎ
🫧 Seollin said Jubin brought back pudding, so cute lol

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Hehe  
Seollin unnie asked, "When are you going to Japan, Binnie??"  
So I said, "The day after tomorrow!!"  
And she was like, "OMG.. just one pudding please ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ"  
So as a gift  
Ta-da  
I gave it to her  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
She liked it so much  
I was happy too..ㅎㅎ
🫧 Did you also fill your suitcase with food, Binnie??

No, I bought  
a bit less  
A tiny regret is  
I bought too many gifts  
so I couldn’t buy much for myself  
But it's okay because I'll go again for the Japan debut showcase
🫧 Did you have melon bread??? 🥺

Yeah!! I also had crepes  
And the tiramisu I had last time  
❤️❤️  
The crepes were Shinwi unnie's recommendation  
All the members loved it  
So they said they want to eat it again next time  
And as a Tetris master  
I packed everything into my luggage  
Phew  
(Actually, I failed a bit because of the time limit in Tetris)  
As expected  
I was roommates with Sumin unnie  
We were like  
"Oh, we're usually roommates, so this is comfortable, for real"  
And since our routines are similar  
"Going to sleep? Okay, me too"  
And then we slept  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Even in the morning, we woke up  
"Wow, I'm really tired"  
at the same time  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Oh right  
The last "meow" star of the other day was  
Seollin unnie 😉
🫧 Was it hot in Japan?

But it wasn’t that hot..  
When I said that, everyone was like, "What?"  
It was hot though  
Even though I don’t usually sweat  
my whole body was drenched  
It was less hot than I expected..  
but still hot.  
Oh yeah  
Today  
I wore glasses  
🤓🤓  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I wasn’t wearing them at first  
But I put them on in the middle because I got lost and thought they might announce something..  
It was for vision, not fashion  
ㅋㅋㅅㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
My eyesight is probably bad..  
Yeah, it’s bad……
🫧 Missing person… wearing glasses… round and round…

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Are they really your glasses, Binnie?

Yeah, my everyday glasses  
But I don’t wear them much  
I just give up on clear vision  
And then wear them when I’m practicing or need to focus on something  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I see the world  
blurry..
🫧 Glasses ...... really suit you.. If you get the chance, wear them again next time...

Got it.  
But seriously, I just look like Pororo  
ㅎ  
Hehe  
ㅌㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Got it ^~^  
Odaiba Mezamashi  
It felt like I started before I even realized it was Japan  
I was nervous, but seeing the wave from the stage was fun and exciting  
I wanted to show even more ~~~~ ^~*  
🫧 Calling you baby Jubin was cute 👶🩵

🤍🤍🤍🤍  
Originally in my introduction,  
I just said, "Konnichiwa, it's S18 Jubin!"  
But Tone unnie said  
In the waiting room,  
"No, no, you should say, 'Aka-chan Jubin desu!'"  
So I was like, "Oh, okay!"  
Later, I found out it had a special meaning  
As the youngest of Team A…  
Baby Bin……  
That’s what I did……  
ㅌㅋㄱㅌㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
VM  
⸜(♡’ᗜ‘♡)⸝  
Oh, I was going to say something else  
But I forgot  
Oh and  
Ta-da  
Can you see?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Not my first selfie in Japan  
But let’s just say it is
🫧 But your selfie skills seem to be improving?

Everyone around me  
used to ask why I’m so bad at taking selfies  
So I’ve been practicing a bit..  
I’ve unlocked my fixed angle  
ㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 How much of your beauty do you think your selfies capture these days? 🫠

About 35%?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 What are you saying, 1%!

; Sorry
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Even your fixed angle was cuteㅎㅎ  
Consistent cheek poke, half-heart, and the pose where you place your hand under your lips.

They're all cute, but sometimes, please take a selfie with your fixed angle too ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ That one  
Mom always says  
"Bin-ah, do you not know any other poses?"  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hahaha  
Mother, I'm studying it ^^  
Every time my mom sees a photo, she says,  
"All you do is poke your cheek, and even the angle is the same diagonal"  
But since she was right, I felt a little guilty..ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 What’s your favorite pose these days?

These days,  
the profile pic pose 😽  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
A kind of rawr pose  
Something like that?  
Oh, and  
Sumin unnie and I were at Don Quijote doing some browsing  
We were looking at bread spreads  
and we both bought the same one  
But it turns out  
you have to finish it within a month after opening  
and neither of us could finish that amount in a month  
………  
So  
….We should have just bought one….  
and shared it….  
Luckily,  
we have 24 members  
and 24 mouths!  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I really love that we have so many members  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But seriously,  
I enjoyed Japanese food and scenery so much..  
Even when we ate together,  
we could order a lot and share a bite of everything  
That was the best part  
I want to go to Japan again soon..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I want to go to Japan tooooo

We're on the same page  
Good, let’s go together  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Go a lot and recommend some places later

I’ll go for the showcase first  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
And even while performing on the Japanese stage  
It was so fun  
I want to go to Japan, study more Japanese,  
and later do my self-introduction perfectly without asking the Japan-line unnies for help  
That’s my goal  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
Oh, when you think of Japan Dimension,  
you realize we can go more often  
That’s right  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Do you want to?

Hmm  
I think it would be good  
Like  
after finishing "Girls Never Die"  
the first unit? I want to gain more experience  
🫧 You just enjoy being active, right?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
You got me  
Sumin unnie and I  
will do another convenience store raid when we go to Japan  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ll show you the cuteness of  
16-year-old Binnie  
in Japan ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
"Girls Never Die" ended too quickly  
So I feel like I want to do more activities  
Whatever they may be  
I just want to work harder  
Hehe
🫧 Thanks, Binnie, for always working so hard

No, I’ll work even harder!!  
So keep watching me!!!  
At this moment, I should say  
I love you~~~~~  
You know that?  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Yeah, me too 🤍🤍🤍🤍  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Binnie, what are you thinking about right now???

Thinking of you?  
ㅋ  
Oh, but  
Even though I’ve only been to Japan twice so far  
That baked creamy cheese?  
That’s a must  
Please  
You have to try it  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It literally melts in your mouth  
Actually, a bit less than two months after I moved in?  
Around then..?  
Dahyun unnie  
gave it to me and asked if I wanted to try it  
I ate it and it was seriously  
so so much  
my style  
I was like, "Unnie, this is so delicious..!!!"  
So I remembered it and bought two this time  
I haven’t eaten them yet  
but I’m sure they’re delicious  
It’s kind of a cheese-flavored snack  
but more like something that melts in your mouth  
Conclusion: It’s delicious
🫧 Do you know Dahyun's meme too? Binnie, you're really good and so cute~

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Yeahhh  
It's trending in tripleS  
Dahyun unnie sings well and is good at everything  
So yesterday, we spent the whole time  
praising each other  
🫧 Binnie, you're good at cooking, and... not good at it

ㅍ  
?  
Are you giving me a compliment and an insult at the same time?  
Thanks... I guess?  
^~~^~~^~~^  
Waeve (Wave) is really cute and funny ^~~^  
🫧 I know that

?  
Waeve is really... amazing... and awesome...  
🫧 That's a well-known fact

ㅇWooong ㅎㅎ  
🫧 That's a well-known fact

ㅇWooong ㅎㅎ  
Okay, here's a question  
Did I dry my hair or not?  
The answer is  
It's air drying  
💨💨💨💨💨💨💨🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️  
Oh, right  
Sumin unnie's curtain reminded me  
Sumin unnie and Hayoung unnie bought something like blackout curtains  
Suddenly, Sumin unnie was rustling around in her room  
I was like, "What's going on?"  
She said, "Help me...."  
So I went,  
and then I perfectly sealed  
the room with curtains  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But after that,  
Hayoung unnie was like,  
"Can you install mine too?"  
But I didn't  
ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
"You should try doing it yourself!!"  
So she did it alone  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
But it was really  
strange  
and loose  
She repurposed the blackout curtains for something else  
But Sumin unnie and I  
kind of expected that  
And she said,  
"No, it's well hung"  
Actually,  
we’re on a call right now  
I'm getting a live update  
through a video call  
6: "Oh, it’s not hung well~~~ It looks really weird~~~~"  
19: "No, look at this"  
6: "Oh, it’s not bad?"  
6: "Did someone help you?"  
19: "Sion unnie helped me"  
20: "Hey~~~ Binnie, didn't you buy a tent too?"  
6: "Yeah, unnie, aren't you buying one?"  
"Should I send you the link?"  
So, we're starting another group buy  
🫧 It's strange; it's just text, but I can hear Sumin and Sion’s voices. Have I been hacked?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Actually,  
when Sumin unnie said she bought that,  
I was like, "I want to put it up tooㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜ"  
Then unnie was like, "Hey, I saw something, do you want me to share it with you??"  
"Oh, yes, please, please, please"  
So I bought something that can be set up like a tent  
🫧 The group uses numbers like 6, 19, and 20, and yet you can understand them?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
One of a kind  
Unique  
🫧 Binnie, you won’t just stay in there and never come out, right..?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Sumin unnie said that  
"You... wow, this is really nice..? Oh... If you're alone inside, no one will know.. This is really nice...."  
She said that  
🫧 Now Sumin can't suddenly pop in and see you sleeping

But I feel like Sumin would just ignore the tent and come in ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hul  
Exactly  
Sumin unnie said that too  
ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ  
6: "Ah.. But there's one thing I'm sad about.."  
18: "What??"  
6: "If you put up the tent.. I won’t be able to see you sleeping ㅎ"  
18: "……….Ha…."  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅌㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ah,  
thank goodness ^~~^~~^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But now that we're talking,  
Sumin unnie's typos keep coming out as "Suming unnie"  
And somehow "Suming unnie" seems  
cuter  
🫧 Suming and Jubing

Hmm  
Never mind  
I like Sumin unnie better  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㅅㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Oh, that was a typo? It happened so often that I thought you were doing it on purpose

Half typo,  
Half "Oh, it’s not bad?"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ahhhhhhhhh  
Just tried it ^~*  
Tomorrow’s meal suggestion:  
Korean food  
Bibimbap?!!  
Gamjatang (pork bone soup)??!  
Something  
with a spicy feel  
🫧 So Binnie wants to eat something spicy???

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Bingo  
🫧 Binnie, you're so transparent ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

It’s crystal clear  
Like transparent~~~  
Oh no,  
now everything looks like song lyrics  
ㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Oh dear, it’s the first day, but Jubing is talking a lot. What should I do? It’s so fun

When that happens  
Just enjoy it  
💃🤸‍♀️🕺💃  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Enjoy it, enjoy~~~~~~  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Heh  
VM  
🫧 But honestly, I always enjoy Binnie’s From. ^^ I hope you do too

🥕🥕🥕  
Teasing Waeve is so much fun ^~^  
Hehehhehehe  
Now,  
I’m going to listen to Onochoo  
and go to sleep  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
Onochoo is  
a song I listened to after a long time a few days ago  
I replayed it  
It’s a song  
Right away  
right away..!!!!  
Do it, do it, do it, do it  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Actually, a few days ago,  
while I was just practicing,  
I played the tripleS playlist  
and as I was skipping through, Do It came on  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So I listened to it,  
and suddenly remembered  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Now I’m going  
to sleep  
See you tomorrow  
Bye bye!!  
VM
