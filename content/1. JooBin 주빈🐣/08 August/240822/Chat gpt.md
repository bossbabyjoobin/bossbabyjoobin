**Translation:**

Hey  
You’ve been here before?  
Huh?  
What are you talking about right now..  
I came before going to sleep lol  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I want to attack JooBim  

Go ahead and try  
JooBim!!!!  
During today’s live  
Oh, from the start  
I made a voice appearance.  
SooMin unnie told me to stay next to her.  
So  
When the camera was off for a bit,  
I handled things diligently.  
^~*  
🫧 Did you do the laundry?

? Did you hear the dryer finishing sound or something?  
Ah,  
It’s Me :)  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I wanted to give off a realistic vibe,  
so it was planned.  
You know dust?  
Dust?  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
It’s midnight.  
Happy Thursday  
Honestly, I think I like Thursdays.  
I always had a class I liked.  
Of course, not this time though.  
Thursdays are kind of like,  
When Thursday’s over,  
It’s Friday!!!  
Then the weekend!!!  
I always felt happy thinking like that.  
🫧 What was the class you liked??

Usually music  
Band  
Stuff like that?  
🫧 Did Bini ever play the Danso* in music class?

I tried playing it in elementary school.  
But after I started the flute,  
it was easy.  
The mouth shape,  
hands,  
stuff like that were similar,  
so I found it kind of interesting.  
🫧 That’s something only the chosen ones by the Danso god can play, so Bini was a chosen one.

?  
Oh  
Chosen by accident.  
🫧 Did you ever cook at school?

When I was younger, I think I did something.  
Made sandwiches and other stuff.  
That was the most fun.  
`+` After the exams were over, movie & snack party.  
🫧 What’s your favorite snack?

Now that I think about it,  
I don’t think I can pick a favorite.  
In any category.  
Food.. members.. hobbies..  
I can’t choose any of them.  
🫧 Not just now, but you’ve always been like that.

Ah  
!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 But Bini, we’re your favorite… That’s for sure, right?

Yeah, right, that’s correct  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Why is it still Thursday? Bini, take responsibility and make it Friday.

Well, since I’m not the time fairy,  
it’s impossible..  
🫧 But we’re sure you’re our favorite, Bini..

🥕🕺💃🕺💃  
Ah, I’m sleepy  
I went to school today,  
and I woke up way too early.  
Goodbye  
What does ‘goodbye’ mean?  
🫧 Nah, it’s okay. Pull an all-nighter and sleep at school.

I’ve never slept at school lol  
It’s kind of like my pride… Of course,  
It’s a resolution.  
🫧 So, while you were at school, I slept enough for both of us in advance.

Oh, you knew it from back then?  
Such a foresighted WAV.  
🫧 I was dead tired at school but only showed up for P.E., but not JooBin, huh?

P.E. is tough..  
I don’t like outdoor classes.  
It’s too hot.  
I think only outdoor classes in autumn  
are good.  
🫧 Bini, SooMin keeps ‘claiming’ that she’s gotten taller. Is it true?

Let’s fact-check  
It’s true….. ㅇㅇㅇ  
She’s slightly  
taller, I think.  
Her eye level  
is a bit higher.  
For real.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Mayu unnie too  
was like, “Oh..! But I kept thinking today,  
SooMin seems a bit taller.”  
But honestly,  
I noticed it today too.  
Could it be the result of yesterday’s 500 jump ropes???  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㄹㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’ll jump rope too.  
^~^~^  
Haha  
These days, for health,  
I’m working out a little bit,  
but I’m not sure if I have more energy yet……….  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Oh, and  
I’ll recommend what I ate today.  
Homemade salad  
Ingredients: cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, mini mozzarella cheese, corn, meat (chicken breast), onions, olive oil, balsamic sauce  
Ah,  
`+` lettuce  
Just chop everything  
small and  
mix it all together.  
It’s tasty.  
I ate it twice today.  
🫧 I ate the meat listed there, so I’ve had salad too, right?

..  
Meat and salad are  
quite different  
…..  
🫧 What, that’s just a hamburger!

? There’s no bread though.  
🫧 I ate a pork cutlet with mozzarella cheese in it, so I ate salad too.

? But there’s no frying involved.  
..  
Fine, I’ll just give a recommendation for tomorrow’s meal.  
^~^  
This is what you wanted, right?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Cold soybean noodles  
Pork cutlet  
Yukhoe bibimbap  
Gamjatang  
Pick one.  
I’m going to eat yogurt.  
🫧 Why isn’t Bini eating something delicious?

Yogurt is delicious  
!!!!!  
I’ve stocked up five Greek yogurts in the fridge.  
There are about 40 milk and soy milk packs too.  
🫧 What do you eat with Greek yogurt?

Tomorrow, I’m going to eat it with blueberries.  
🫐🫐🫐🫐🫐  
🫧 Do you have your own separate fridge?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋNo  
Milk and soy milk are stored at room temperature..  
I just put them in the fridge when I’m about to drink them.  
🫧 How do you store ‘I Love Milk’???!!!??

In my heart!✨✨✨✨✨😉😉😉  
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
Why’d you suddenly go quiet?  
🫧 Why’d you go quiet too?

ㅎ  
Does it work?  
🫧 Even if you say it doesn’t, you’ll still go to sleep..

Hmm,  
that’s true.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Yeah, it works.

ㅇㅋ  
헷  
헤ㅔ헤ㅔ헤  
❤️  
Hehe  
Good night  
🤍
