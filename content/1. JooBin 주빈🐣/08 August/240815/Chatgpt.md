**VM1**  
🫧 Wow, I was just thinking that Bini would come around now, and here you are!

That’s telepathy for you.  
So,  
What are you doing?  
Oh.  
ㅋ  
I’m just getting ready for bed, sitting against the wall on my bed.  
🫧 Since I have three arms, I’ll be doing a plank while doing Fromm.

?  
Three arms? That’s impressive.  
🫧 Are we even on Earth right now?

I don’t know anymore.  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 What’s the longest you’ve held a plank, Bini?

3 minutes and 40 seconds...?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Oh, that’s enough time to listen to a whole song!

ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Only did it once in my life ^^  
🫧 So, normally, you only last one verse....

Oh 
That was just the intro...  
;;;;;;  
^~^~^~^~^~^
What.  
🫧 Let’s try it again 

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Let’s go learn planks from Sion together.

I tried home workouts, squats, and so on,  
but during practice, I kept saying, “Unnie, this really isn’t it. When does this end? This really isn’t it. I really can’t do this.”  
x100  
I was like that during practice ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Just attempting to learn is something.

..Thanks.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 ???: Park Sion is always working out whenever I see her.

Yeah…  
Not being able to work out because of time and place is just an excuse.  
She’s the kind of person who…  
even when we went to eat poke,  
said, “Wait a sec, I’ll be right back,”  
and then went out the back door to do 30 squats, lunges, and jumping jacks.  
After seeing that,  
I realized,  
this unnie is really serious.  
🫧 Stop lying.

Why would I lie about something like this……  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
We should start small, like exercising for 10 minutes a day.  
Let’s try again..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What small habits are you practicing these days, Bini?

Drinking water whenever I think of it!!  
I bought a tumbler with Ryan and Chunsik on it a while ago,  
vowed to drink more water,  
but that didn’t last.  
So, I’m trying again lately~~  
🫧 Are you still using that tumbler you bought back then?

...I used it about 7 times?  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Merchandise isn’t meant to be used anyway ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

I think you’re right.  
Heh.  
People who use tumblers all the time are amazing.  
You have to carry it around, and it doesn’t even fit in your bag.  
I’m more of a water bottle person.  
I carry a water bottle around instead.  
🫧 I carry mine in my bag though..?

?  
Doesn’t it spill???  
?????  
Is it without a straw?  
Oh,  
mine has a straw attached.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Real men don’t use straws.

Oh, is that how it is?  
^~^  
🫧 Real men drink tap water.

..  
Alright,  
Drink lots of water.  
Good luck.  
🫧 Amateurs. You should be carrying drinks in your mouth all day.

Have you given up on talking altogether..?  
🫧 This is scary..

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
In times like these,  
Just skip it.  
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️  
🫧 I’m so happy it’s Friday tomorrow! Do you have any weekend plans, Bini?

Fansign..?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’m going to meet WAV.  
🫧 How does it feel to do fansigns? Is it fun?

It’s fun.  
But seriously,  
it’s fun.  
We used to have a bunch of them after promotions ended, remember?  
That was really fun, actually.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Is the vibe at your fansign similar to this Fromm?

I don’t think so.  
People say I feel different when I talk versus when I message.  
In real conversations, I’m a bit less… annoying.  
But when it’s in a message,  
I’m somehow really good at being annoying.  
🫧 What do you mean? You’re super annoying, Bini.

Nyo? ⸜(♡’ᗜ‘♡)⸝ >~<  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㅌㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But no,  
more often than not,  
it’s WAV who can’t get the words out and just skips over it.  
“Uh, I didn’t say anything at all???”  
Shock.  
🫧 I’m nervous..

Don’t be nervous!!!  
We talk on Fromm 365 days a year,  
just bring that sense of closeness with you.  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
🫧 Can I use banmal during the fansign?

Yeah,  
you’re already doing it now, so why not?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bini, you should speak banmal to us at the fansign too...

..If you do it first,  
I can do it.  
🫧 What should I say first?

“Biniiiiiiiniiiiiiiiing”  
🫧 Fact: JooBin is surprisingly well-behaved in person.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Why is that surprising?  
?-?  
🫧 Bini is unexpectedly cute.

?  
Well,  
yes…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 It’s Hayeon, and I get so annoyed talking to Bini ㅋ

No,  
Hayeon unnie,  
sometimes you come in being all cute,  
but other times you say I’m annoying.  
Your mood depends on the day.  
🫧 It’s just because she likes you.

Sigh, it can’t be helped, can it?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 If you’ve changed this much in six months, I wonder what you’ll be like in another six months.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I don’t know,  
but I hope I’ll grow even more.  
`~~~~~~~~~~`  
🫧 Give a name to Bini fans!

What is this?  
Fry pan?  
..  
Sorry ㅎ  
🫧 JooBin, practice your jokes a bit more.  
**VM**  
We’re the  
Simranies  
^~*  
🫧 What is that in English? 👉🥺👈

..wellll  
(un)easy  
Heh  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 This isn’t easy;;;

That’s true.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Out of nowhere, am I the only one who finds Bini funny?

I think I’m funny too,  
but I didn’t write this.  
🫧 Everything is funny except when you’re telling jokes.

Oh really!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But I never tell jokes.  
I got this from WAV.  
..  
Oh, WAV got it from me?  
ㅎ  
I didn’t know.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Not “I don’t tell jokes” x  
“I can’t tell jokes” o

You’ve got it reversed ^~^  
🫧 When that happens, you should attack with a JooBim.

**JooBim attack!!!!**  
(∩^o^)⊃━☆ﾟ.`*`･｡  
Oh no chu??  
Wait a sec  
**Close To You**  
“Why do birds~~~  
Suddenly appear`~~`”  
This song is great in its original version,  
but the covers are all great too.  
By The Carpenters.  
It’s a cute but  
exciting  
song.  
🫧 The song is from the 70s...

..??  
Oh,  
I like it 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻  
After “Oh no chu,”  
let’s do “Jeommae chu.”  
Cold noodles, hot dogs, cheese balls, squid butter grilled.  
🫧 I think everyone will have the same reaction, so I’ll be the one to appreciate it.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Sometimes the same reaction is good.  
..But not really.  
🫧 What kind of combo is that???

Just a random mix I came up with.  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
ㅎㅎ  
By the way,  
The sky was really beautiful today  
If you have time tomorrow  
Try looking at the sky  
I recommend it  
For healing  
And neck stretching  
🫧 Sunset vs Sunrise?

Sunset  
As for the sunrise..  
It’s pretty, but  
When I was younger  
I wanted to sleep more  
But I remember my dad waking me up to see it  
And it wasn’t such a happy memory  
….  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But the evening sunset  
Feels like it has a deeper hue  
Do you know that??  
Anyway  
That’s why I like it  
Now  
It’s time for everyone to sleep  
🫧 Should we say goodbye now?

Why do we have to say goodbye~~~~~  
Okay  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Now it’s time~~ for us~~ to say goodbye~~~

Let’s meet again tomorrow~~~~~  
See you tomorrow  
VM  
Bye bye  
`~~~~~`
