Hey  
I'm so late, aren't I...  
I was practicing today and doing some other stuff, so I got a bit lateㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜ  
🫧 You waited even though you were sleepy, right? Good job.

ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ Well done.  
If you're sleepy,  
go to bed.  
Got it?!!!  
I'll come every day, so you can just go to sleep and watch it the next day.  
Okay?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 JooBin-ah, it's my birthday today!!

Happy birthday!  
Happy birthday to all the WAVs born in August!  
🫧 Does JooBin not need to sleep?

I should, but...  
🫧 I'm touched.

Yay, mission success  
^~^  
But I really wanted to see you, though.  
Hehe  
While waiting,  
what were you doing?  
Did you say there was a shooting star falling?  
Wow,  
that's amazing.  
🫧 Let's make a wish, JooBin!!!!!!!

Okay!!!  
☆Done☆  
🫧 What's your wish? Tell me!

You can't say your wish out loud.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It's a secret.  
I hope I can live happily with WAVs for a long time..☆  
Feeling emotional.. Is that right ☆?  
🫧 This is too cheesy.

S-sorry  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binniee is your new nickname, Binkongie?

Oh right,  
it's cute, isn't it?  
How is it?  
I wrote that in the guestbook,  
and I felt proud.  
^~^~^  
It's cute.  
I'm satisfied.  
🫧 Your handwriting is cute too, Binnie.

Hehe  
Thanks for noticing the point.  
😉  
🫧 That guestbook shows all the members' personalities, it's so funny ㅋㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ For real.  
By the way, today,  
if I make some typos, please understand.  
Forgive me.  
I changed my nails,  
so I'm not used to it.  
🫧 It's okay. Is it just a day or two?

Uh-huh?  
🫧 What color did you change them to?

Guess what.  
Nude pink  
🤍🎀  
This kind of vibe  
🫧 It would be perfect for ASMR.  
VM1  
This is serious.  
I did this too well.  
Ah, sorry.  
Lower the volume  
before you press it.  
Haha  
🫧 Actually, Binnie's voice is so cute that it's ASMR on its own.

Uh... that's not my voice, though.  
Anyway, okay.  
ㅎㅎ  
By the way, you know,  
the selfie of Tone unnie and Seoyeon unnie  
on the airplane?  
I made that happen.  
How is it?  
Hee  
Hee  
I wrote "I'm sleepy..." in my memo  
and Airdropped it to the members  
while waiting on the plane.  
Then, I got several repliesㅠ They were coming in like crazy.  
Tone unnie replied with a selfie of her and Seoyeon unnie saying,  
"Get some sleep..."  
So, I replied with a selfie too,  
saying, "OK!"  
That selfie is  
hidden  
under the frozen Han River...  
J/k  
I hid it.  
Heh  
ㅋ  
I'll show it to you sometime if you want.  
If *I* want to.  
ㅎ  
ㅋㅌㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Oh right,  
I'm practicing the four-cut photos.  
I'll bring some good results  
later.  
🫧 Oh, I'm sleepy.

Me too.  
Let's go to bed now.  
Let's meet again tomorrow.  
🫧 No, I'm not sleepy.

You're not sleepy, huh?  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I'll come again tomorrow.  
Okay??  
🫧 I'm going to write a letter today, so take a good look!

Of course.  
All the WAVs left letters yesterday too.  
ㅎㅎ  
It was a bit touching.  
Even though it was so sudden,  
I'm always grateful.  
Thank you for loving me and letting me love you.  
Sleep well today too,  
and good job.  
I love you.  
VM1  
VM2  
Bye bye!  
🤍❤️🤍❤️
