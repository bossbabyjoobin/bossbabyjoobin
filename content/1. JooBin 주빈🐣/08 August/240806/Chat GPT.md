🫧 What are you up to?  
!!  
🫧 I just found out that I’m not an actual member of JooManSa...? I was just kidding, though.  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hah.  
🫧 But what’s with your hosting skills getting better and better??  

Yay!  
I told you,  
I’m going to keep improving.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Yuyeong-unnie was wondering when she’ll get an invite.  

Gasp.  
The waiting list is getting longer.  
^~^  
In my heart, I’ve already decided on the next and the one after that guest.  
But I haven’t started observing them yet.  
It’s a secret.  
🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hey,  
[Y/N] !!  
I just called you out randomly.  
Hehe.  
🫧 Are you bored, by any chance?

Oh,  
Correct!  
No,  
look here.  
![[GUThG_KaIAEhIRs.jpg|150]]  
![[GUThHAmbEAACzHv.jpg|150]]  
Hmph,  
that day,  
a WAVE asked me,  
“What’s the concept for today?”  
I was like, um... kind of,  
like a forsythia?  
But then I thought, “Wait, not a chick... but a forsythia...?”  
So I corrected myself to “chick.”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So,  
in our room,  
Soomin-unnie and Seollin-unnie  
were just exchanging looks,  
then suddenly started shouting,  
“Type Princess~~~~~~~~  
Ah~” 
and kept running around.  
Then, Soomin-unnie started talking about something,  
saying her nail art is uncomfortable.  
But she said,  
“If I have fingers, it’s uncomfortable.”  
Wait, fingers...?!  
Oh, nails~~~~~  
Life feels like a sitcom sometimes…  
But, really, it’s not that having nails is uncomfortable;  
it’s the nail art that makes them uncomfortable.  
So she says...  
🫧 Haesolmae-nim is amazing. I think I’d quit as a manager after just one day.  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I think it would be tough for me too…  
🫧 Who are the top three members that you find the hardest to handle?

Number 1: Soomin-unnie.  
Number 2: Sinwee-unnie.  
Number 3:  
Number 3: Seoa.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Seoa-ga-ya~~~

Baby.  
🫧 Your top three favorite people?

..  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Surprisingly, Hayoung’s not on the list, haha.

Actually, I did consider Hayoung and Chaewon-unnie,  
but they’re both difficult,  
so I just went with the cute Seoa.  
🫧 What rank is Yeonji?

Yeonji-unnie talks... a lot...  
but it seems like she talks even more when she’s with the members,  
so I don’t think she’s hard to handle.  
Or maybe...  
I’m starting to want to take that back.  
🫧 Does Seoa still rush at you these days?

Of course.  
She pretends she’s walking sneakily, but it’s so obvious.  
Then she tries to hug me secretly, but again, it’s so obvious.  
🫧 At least she’s not doing Taekwondo on you.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Thanks…  
🫧 If it were me, I’d just pretend not to notice and hug her back.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I do that sometimes.  
🫧 This wild TripleS life is really something,,,

…..Is it just something?  
🫧 If you dodge her once... will Seoa get upset?

I tried it,  
and she went,  
“Whyyeeeeeeeee~!!!  
Why are you dodging me?”  
So I ran off somewhere else,  
and she chased after me, yelling,  
“Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!”  
🫧 Since you’re slow, I guess you got caught.

Ah, so that’s why I got caught.  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Let’s just say that you’re so kind that you let yourself get caught on purpose.  

….That’s a nice thought.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Today’s recommended menu:  
Kongguksu and  
mandu  
!!!  
Eating something refreshing  
makes you feel better.  
It’s because it’s summer.  
🫧 What kind of combination is that?

It’s a Joobin special.  
To be honest, I’ve never tried it.  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
🫧 Are we your taste testers now…

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Kongguksu and mandu is like the perfect combination of you and Hayoung.

What, are you two rushing at each other?  
^~*  
It seems like it wouldn’t match, but it’s actually perfect.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Nice.  
🫧 Kimchi mandu VS meat mandu

Steamed bun.  
🫧 Oh, I heard you’re learning Japanese from Tone these days?

Yeah,  
I am, I am~~~~  
Do you know what “naedae-naedae~~~~” means?  
It means,  
“pat-pat~~~~~”  
🫧 Naedae-naedae means “showing off”?

No……………..🫧 Naedae-naedae means “showing off”?

No……………  
🫧 Please give me Joobin.  
![[240806_2.m4a]]  
Yesterday, I did a relay of “please” with Tone-unnie.  
🫧 I’m good at it too, so listen to mine.

?  
Are you challenging me to a battle?  
Should I accept  
this challenge  
or not?  
I think I might lose.  
The importance of spacing:  
“I might loseㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠ”  
versus  
“I might win!!!”  
Sorry.  
ㅎ  
ㅎ  
ㅎ  
🫧 2 points

Yoohoo, not 1 point!  
Positive thinking is important.  
^~^~^~^  
🫧 Ugh...positive thinking  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ![[240806_3.m4a]]![[240806_4.m4a]]![[240806_5.m4a]]Ah, that was weak.  
Wow,  
it’s a tight match.  
…….  
It’s like  
my phone is getting colder.  
Let me try one.  
This is a dad joke Chaewon-unnie would like.  
If a strawberry is strong, what is it?!  
🫧 Wow, that’s funnyㅋㅋㅋㅋ

I didn’t even give the answer yet.  
![[240806_6.m4a]]  
🫧 Whether it’s you or us...

It’s scary how we all know what’s coming.  
This match is over.  
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️  
Let’s change the topic.  
🫧 Hello, Fairy.

Hi, yo.  
🫧 Fairy, bring us some fun stories.

I’m not a real person,  
so I don’t have any stories...  
🫧 It’s been a while since we’ve seen a fairy.

Long time no see.  
🫧 Fundamental question! Are your wings like insect wings or like bird feathers?

Tinkerbell wings.  
🧚🏻‍♀️  
They look like this.  
How dare you compare me to a moth…  
I’m immune to bug spray, you know.  
ㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Can you tell us the next guest on JooManSa?

They’re still just  
a candidate,  
but...  
um,  
well,  
they might talk a lot or a little,  
~  
and they might be a good dancer?  
Something like that.  
🫧 That’s way too broad???????????????

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 In that case, it’s me.

?  
WAVE.  
Dance champ competition.  
💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺🕺  
🫧 I’ll be joining in soon.

…  
🫧 I’m really confident.

Our WAVE  
is confident in dancing...?  
I didn’t know.  
All this time,  
I bet you’ve been wanting to show me your dance moves whenever we met.  
How did you hold back…?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But there are some WAVEs who’ve shown me their moves.  
🫧 Never held back; it’s just that Bini didn’t see it.

Uh..
I like the no-holding-back attitude.
🫧 Oh right, I did dance, didn’t I…?

ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Sorry, but I still haven’t seen the dance champ in you yet.
Step it up!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You know how it’s cool when someone who doesn’t look like they can dance ends up being really good? That’s me.
🫧 You’re just saying whatever you want, huh?

Bingo!
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 WAV’s confidence is like Joobin’s cooking skills..

? Nah
Today, I even asked again to please let me do a solo Cooking Signal.
Seriously.
ㅜ
🫧 At this point, the company must know about your cooking skills and that’s why they’re turning you down.

……
ㅎㅎ
Oh, right,
Sleep well
ㅎ
WAV’s teamwork is impressive.
All I see are question marks.
🫧 The pace is too fast, teacher.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 If I get to do a fansign with you, what should I say?

Ask anything you want.
A million things, maybe not that many, but
I’ll answer them all.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Can I bite your arm?

?
🫧 Bini TMI from when you were one year old.

?
🫧 I’ll really ask a million things.

???????
..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
WAVs aren’t easy.
🫧 I don’t want to get hit with a Joobin punch.

Sounds like you do.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 If Joobin punches me and then holds her hand because it hurts, that’d be just like her.

🥕
🫧 I’ve never heard a punch ASMR before.

It’s an honor to be your first.
✨
ㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 How about gloves as your next fansign item?

Bring it on.
🥊🥊
No, never mind. Get out.
Sorry, I’ll leave.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’ve got 23 people behind me..!!
But I won’t challenge you.
ㅎㅎ
I tried a punching machine before,
everyone was impressed.
Wow..😲😲😲😲😲
The reason is a secret.
They thought it was broken.
The reason is a secret.
..
Secret
Sleep sleep sleep
ㅎㅎ
🫧 Sleep vs. Not sleeping

..
🫧 Sleep well
🫧 You worked hard today too
Goodnight
❤️
