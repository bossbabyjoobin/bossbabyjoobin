**VM1**
What are you up to?
Did you get home safely??
🫧 I'm heading home now…

Aww, be careful going in.
🫧 I saw Binnie today, but I think I showed up looking too drenched…

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ No, it's fine.  
I got soaked too.  
Like a wet rat, la la la la~
🫧 Did you have fun?

Yeah, and I was nervous.  
I wasn’t shaking in my head, but my hands were trembling.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
First water festival!!💦💦  
It was a bit slippery, but luckily none of the members got hurt.  
Don't worry about me; I'm strong.  
💪💪  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
But I couldn’t dance properly because it was so slippery, so I couldn’t show my best.  
I’m really sorry.  
I wanted to show you a better performance.  
🤍🥺🤍🤍  
I'll work harder and do better next time!!!  
🫧 Then I guess I’ll just have to see Binnie again, haha.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Seems like it, haha.  
🫧 How was shooting the water gun?

Honestly,  
as soon as I pulled the water gun lever,  
the water just came gushing out,  
and I was like, “Oh no!”  
I was flustered but excited.  
It was fun.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
The water gun is mine.  
I can shoot it whenever I want.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Is there anyone you'd want to shoot with the water gun?

Our WAV, whom I love so much? Hehe  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’m shooting out of love.  
🫧 Who's willing to get hit?

I’m the one shooting, so...  
ㅋ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Actually, I don’t really like water gun fights.  
Let’s just look at each other peacefully.  
I just want to live peacefully with WAVs,  
like water flowing smoothly,  
without the actual water…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I think a thrilling life is okay too, hehe.

How about enjoying a slightly boring life sometimes, hehe.  
🫧 So that’s why you didn’t go into the water in Gapyeong?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Right.  
I’m not a fan of water.  
I was excited today, but I didn’t want to get soaked…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Honestly, I had a water gun,  
but I didn’t expect to get hit,  
and I got completely drenched.

I ended up looking like someone who fell into a bowl of soggy lettuce.  
My hair and clothes were soaked,  
and I didn't look pretty, but it was so fun, so here's a commemorative photo.  
📸📸  
🫧 Binnie is cute even as lettuce!!! You're the prettiest lettuce ever.

…Sweet.  
As long as you like it, it's good, right?  
Washed lettuce is nice.  
💧  
💧  
💧  
🥬  
Oh, I ate lettuce today.  
I just wanted to say that because I suddenly thought of it.  
🫧 I missed Binnie so much, so I ordered lettuce.

Wow, that’s impressive.  
🫧 Seeing Binnie makes me think of samgyeopsal.

Not bad.  
🫧 Please share what Binnie ate today so I can have the same tomorrow.

Ssam-bap!  
`+ Convenience store chocolate that Rin unnie bought for me in Japan.  
Unnie remembered that I said it was delicious once,  
so she kept buying it for me over and over again.  
🥹🫶🏻🫶🏻  
Hehe.  
🫧 Rin is as heartwarming as the 감동란.

………🥚🥚🥚🥚  
🫧 Rin seems cold, but she’s actually a warm unnie.

Agreed.  
Her first impression was like a cool model unnie,  
but that’s not true at all.  
She’s like a cat unnie,  
always looking out for me,  
and she loves me so much…  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🤍  
🫧 Is there anything you want to eat when you go to Japan?

There’s so much.  
Give me recommendations.  
ㅇㅋ  
It must be delicious.  
🫧 Have you never been to Japan?

Yeah.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
That’s why I’m even more excited.  
All the members say it’s amazing,  
so I want to go as soon as possible.  
I’m listening to music right now.  
🫧 What song?

"Virtual Angel" by Artemis sunbaenim.🪽🤍  
I’ve listened to it more than ten times today...🤍  
🫧 But it’s only been 26 minutes today?

…You're precise.  
Yesterday + today.  
^~^  
🧚🏻‍♀️✨✨✨✨  
The fairy has returned with a  
Q&A session!  
🫧 My nose is so dry, what should I do?

I recommend turning on a humidifier while you sleep.  
🫧 How old are you, fairy?

Oh, that’s a secret.  
Roughly a million years old?  
🫧 Isn’t that a bit too rough of an answer?

That’s my charm!  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I had a tough day today. What should I have for a late-night snack?

Gopchang?  
But I don’t like it.  
🫧 If kimchi played rock-paper-scissors and chose rock, why did it lose?

Because how can kimchi choose rock!!!  
It’s aged...  
Because it’s aged...  
Next question, please.  
🫧 I think 심란단's jokes are starting to sound like Joobin's. What do you think?

The jokes are a bit, uh… yeah.  
🫧 I already want to see JooManSa episode 3, what should I do, Binnie?

Me too…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie! My Korean teacher!!! I'm studying Korean... Can you explain the difference in pronunciation between "코피" and "커피"?ㅠㅠㅠㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Alright,  
코피's "코" is like in "코오오!!!!!," like when you say "To-nay unnie!"  
커피's "커" is like in "신위 unnie is so tall!"  
Like "커어어!!!!!"  
Got it?  
🫧 It feels like you’re teaching kindergarteners.

That was my dream job.  
^~^~^  
🫧 A kindergartener?

?  
No, a teacher…………..  
🫧 Is that why you’re good at playing with Yeonji?

ㅜㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋlolllll  
🫧 Kindergarten teachers are good at cooking...

But homeroom teachers don’t have to cook.  
ㅌㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 How did JooManSa's quality improve so much by the second episode? Bbang-ttoua Joobin has leveled up.

…I’ve been observing carefully.  
But this time, Shinwi unnie didn’t know.  
Maybe.  
🫧 Did you personally choose the guests? Tell us some behind-the-scenes details.

It’s all Binnie’s picks.  
Everything is chosen by me.  
🫧 Joobin met Joobin in Joobin's show, JooManJoo.

No, wait.  
We were talking about JooManSa,  
and I was chatting with Rin unnie.  
She said something like "JooManJi"…  
Unnie, that's not even my show...  
?  
…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
As long as you got the gist of it, it's fine~~~~~  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie, let's shorten your name to just two syllables.

It’s already two syllables,  
Joobin.  
Joo-bin.  
Joou-bin.  
🫧 Gwak Joobin sounds fierce.

You’d think I wouldn’t listen to anyone.  
???: Hey, Gwak Joobin!!!  
ㅋ Why are you calling me?  
Pft.  
ㅇㅉ  
That’s how it would be...  
🫧 Isn’t that just Gwak Yeonji?

Oh, is it?  
Sometimes Yeonji unnie calls me like that.  
“Hey! Gwak Joobin! What are you doing!”  
And I’d be like,  
“Wow, that name sounds like I wouldn’t listen to anyone.”  
🫧 What were you thinking when you saw Yeonji and Chaewon’s ending pose up close?

Honestly,  
Yeonji unnie was next to me,  
and since the original ending was her raising her arm towards me,  
I thought she’d obviously do it, so I started to slightly turn my body to the side.  
But then she suddenly moved forward,  
and I was really shocked, thinking, “Is she really going to fall?”  
But she did it on purpose.  
The fact that they both loved their ending pose was the funniest part…  
They took photos and sent them in the group chat,  
and they kept saying, “It was perfect.”  
That’s all they talked about.  
Before, Chaewon unnie asked,  
“How about we all do this kind of ending?”  
Jiwoo unnie and I said we’d clap from the back,  
but at that time, Yeonji unnie said she’d join in…  
I just assumed she wouldn’t actually do it,  
and that was my mistake.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ah, so you made a fierce promise, huh?  
I'm getting sleepy now.  
ㅎㅎ  
Let’s go to sleep.  
Alright, good night.  
VM2  
VM3  
Bye-bye
