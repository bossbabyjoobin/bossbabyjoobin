Hi!!!
What’s up?
You did well.
It’s so hooooot.
🕺💃🕺💃
Just got back from dancing.
It’s so hot.
August is the hottest.
I want fall to come quickly..
So,
Did you do well without me?
🫧 Yeah.

? Yeah, what?
Haha
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
You missed me, didn’t you?
I knew it all along, actually.
🫧 I have school tomorrow, can you give me some comforting words?

ㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅋ
ㅋ
ㅋ
ㅋ
I still have some time left, haha.
Seoah + the Hanlim girls
They’re all jealous of me.
..Woohoo
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 In Japan, high school starts after summer break, on September 1st, but in Korea, it’s from tomorrow⁉️⁉️

It’s different for each school, but I still have some time left!!
🫧 Did you get the latest summer break?

I got it the earliest.
Hehe.
How about a three-month vacation?
Oh right,
When I go back to school,
I’ll be in the same grade as the 07 girls.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But I’ll still graduate with Yeonji unnie.
Yeonji unnie always says,
“No, seriously, you should’ve gone to the same school as me, Bina.”
She always says that.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I can hear her voice automatically.
🫧 When you go back to school, take lots of selfies~~ summer uniform selfies!!!

My summer uniform is just short sleeves..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Bina, would it be weird if I ask if you had dinner at 12?

? A little.
A bit.
A lot.
Yeah, it’s pretty weird..
I did eat.
?:&/”4‘ㅇ
Ah, sorry.
But, like, can’t WAVE members not see messages?
Just how far do these coincidences go?
If we all ate the same meal,
That would be wild.
🫧 I doubt anyone else had jokbal.

..But I did.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It’s always fascinating to me.
Dakdoritang, curry, rose jjimdak, duck, salad, gamjatang, pasta.
? Mint chocolate chicken?
That’s a tough one……..
🫧 Oh yeah, Bina, I heard you ate Jiyeon’s lunchbox.

Wooooaaahh
🥹🥹🥹🥹
Jiyeon unnie’s mom packed it for us members to eat.
I woke up in the middle of the night,
I haven’t eaten late at night in almost six months,
But I ate.
Jiyeon unnie was like, “It’s my first time seeing Bina eat at night..!!!!”
It was really so good.
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ Really.
I even talked to her mom on the phone.
Hehe.
The day I said I ate ssambap,
That was the day.
🫧 You usually don’t eat late at night, do you?

I don’t, but even if I do, I can’t digest it well,
So I can’t sleep.
I don’t eat so I can sleep..?!
🫧 Then just don’t sleep.

..
Oh.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’d rather choose sleep.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 What are you doing right now, Bina?

Talking to you before washing up.
ㅋ
Today, like,
The second or third time.
Something like that.
🫧 Have you ever fallen asleep while waiting?

Nope.
Even if I did, I’d wake up again.
🫧 So when it’s your turn to wash up, is today’s FROM over?

^~^
ㅋㅌㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’ll think about it a bit.
^~^
🫧 Did anything fun happen today?

Today,
Today,
What did I do today, haha?
Oh,
Are you talking about yesterday?
Is it you, T?
🫧 In my neighborhood,

There’s Ediya: check
Mega Coffee: check
Lotteria: check
McDonald’s: check
Bungeoppang truck: check
Sulbing: check

But,

Jubin, only you’re not here...

`#EmotionalQuotes #ConfessionLinesGuaranteedToWork #IKnowYouWontHearMeButIMissYou #SometimesIFeelNostalgic #IStillMissYouEvenThoughIKnowYouWontHearMe`

A bungeoppang truck in this weather?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Gong Yubin: I like Gongcha.

Jubin: Me too.
Oh, right,
I fell asleep while writing the script for JooManSa yesterday.
^~^
The question sheet, I guess.
🫧 Have you thought about what challenge to film afterward?

I’ve written down the challenge too, hehe.
A challenge that stays true to the lyrics of the B-side track.
If it doesn’t turn out well while filming,
It might just disappear,
Heh.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’m off for now.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’ll be back, hehe.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Yeah, see you soon.
[Back after 37 minutes]
ㅋ
A WAVE that couldn’t hold out and fell asleep..
Good night..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Don’t worry, Bini will soon...

ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Would it be too much if I said it took you 40 minutes to shower?

No,
I showered, tidied up,
And came back.
Hehe.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Bina, do you have your own drawer, tidy queen?

Well, we have sections in our room,
And I use this hidden space.
When you open the secret door,
There’s a closet
✨✨✨✨
Inside, there are letters, photos, bags, outerwear,
Everything.
🫧 Do you have any organizing tips, tidy queen Bini?

If you just organize the things you can see... it’ll look tidy.
^~*
🫧 Do you read all your letters, Bini?

Yeah!!!!
I read some today too.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ키
When I organize,
I put the random stuff where they can’t be seen,
And only keep the things I use often in visible places.
Yeah, I read all the letters,
Even the ones on FROM.
Every time I leave,
WAVEs secretly leave letters for me.
I read them all before coming back the next day.
`~~~~`
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It’s cute.
Even though they’re always teasing me during FROM,
As soon as I’m gone,
They write nothing but sweet messages~
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I know everything, hehe.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 They do that because if they don’t, you might get upset and not come back, so...

Pretending to be cool,
^~^
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’ll take it that way.
Keep writing them for me.
🤍
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 What’s the difference between ^~* and ^~^?

Oh,
^~^ is just the default,
And ^~* is a wink.
? Did you think it meant something else?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It’s not a typo.
It has a big meaning!!!!
It’s the big picture.
It’s been a while
Since you’ve seen
Fairy time 🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️
🧚🏻‍♀️✨✨✨✨✨✨
[Y/N], since you have to sleep too,
I’ll take a few questions before I go.
What? Why are you more excited to see the fairy than me?
🫧 Tomorrow’s lunch suggestion?

Curry!!
🫧 I’m curious about Bini’s secret to a good night’s sleep 😙😙

Honestly, even if I’m really tired, I have a hard time falling asleep.
First, I put on an eye mask,
Earplugs,
And I cover myself up to my neck with a blanket,
Then I think to myself, “I’m sleepy.”
🫧 Try sleeping like a jellyfish.

? What’s that?
Do they shake their legs while sleeping?
🫧 I heard Yeonji leaned on your shoulder to sleep when you went to Japan.

It’s true.
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋ
Unnie kept waking up in between,
So I thought she was having a light sleep, but it turns out
She was just like, “Mmm.. zzzzz.”
She thought my shoulder was a neck pillow
And kept leaning on it because it was comfortable.
Yeah, it was my shoulder...
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But the really funny thing is,
A lot of members have leaned on my shoulder.
I even have pictures to prove it.
Sometimes it’s so funny
That I take pictures of it.
At least six pictures..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Is Seoa one of them?

Seoa rests her head on my lap...
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Do the members know about this? The pictures?

Yeah, I showed them when they woke up.
They all cover their faces with their hair and are like, “Is that me?” Haha.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’ll take three more questions
Before I go.
ㅎㅅㅎ
🫧 How much do you love me, Bina?

More than the universe.
Yeah, I miss you.
My recent interest? It’s
Japan!! Snacks!!
I’m looking them up because I’m curious.
Next time I go, I’m determined to buy wisely.
Last question..
🫧 Do you love me?

Yes, 🤍
[Y/N], I love you.
🫧 If I leave a letter on FROM today, will you see it tomorrow?

Yeah, I’ll see it all.
Eat well,
Sleep well,
Rest well!
!!!!

Bye-bye!!!
