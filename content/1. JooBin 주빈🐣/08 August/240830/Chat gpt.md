WAVE
I came by before going to bed
But
After watching the live
I got really sleepy
..
ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Watched Signal
Then watched the live
헷
So
I'll head out in 5 minutes
ㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Bin unnie, have you ever tried finding your genuine laugh sound?

No
At the practice room, the members were going
Hahaha 하하라라라락학락
I was just practicing next to them and watching
While dancing to Girls’ Generation’s ‘Girls’ Generation,’
Suddenly, I heard
학ㅎㄱ가핰ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
from the side, so
…??????
When I looked, they were all lying on the floor
Laughing…
I was holding the camera, filming for about 10 minutes during today's Signal
I didn’t think it would be shown,
But it was, and I went, "Oh? Huh?"
🫧 Bin looked pretty in today’s Signal
(I haven't seen it yet)

What.
Earlier
I went to find Tone unnie
Greeted her
Asked what I needed to ask
JooJoo💚 But I think
I'll be here for another 15 minutes
The reason is
Soomin unnie went to shower and said,
"Joobin-ah, watch how long I take to shower"
Then she closed the door and went in
So I immediately started the stopwatch..
Haha..
![[240830_1.m4a]]
Seollin unnie was talking about this
Laughed
What the
What's this!!!!!‘
Then she dropped something and went
Ahhhhh!!!!!
So funny, just ㅏㅠㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Phew..
Our house is always full of laughter..
Can I say something shocking?
…..
What do you mean, no?
Just listen.
ㅋ
The air conditioner broke……
I’m slowly melting
In this weather
The indoor temperature feels like 30°C
The breeze
Is like
Waayyyyyy too weak
Shooooooouuung…~~
Like that
It’s not cooling!!!!
![[240830_2.m4a]]🫧 Then you can't use the bed tent either since it's too hot

I’m literally melting inside there
Sorry, air conditioner..
At times like this,
Oats
Today's
Ascream
Recommendation
⭐️
Hmm
Pineapple sherbet
Yogurt
That kind of flavor
Phew, it's hot, it's hot
Guess how long Soomin unnie will take
I’m guessing
About 12 minutes
🫧 No fan???

So I’m holding out inside the tent with my mini fan on..
💨💨💨💨💨
🫧 1003 minutes

If it takes that long,
I'll quit halfway.
My mini purple fan is cute
I want to show you
🫧 How can a fan be cute...?

It’s kinda cute because it looks like its owner ^~^
Confiscating your question mark.
Forbidden.
Out.
🫧 !

.. Now you're sending exclamation marks
Soomin unnie said something and didn’t come out
I didn’t understand ㅎㅎ
I can't do this
[Y/N].
Tomorrow
We need to eat
Cold naengmyeon
Soomin unnie came out
It took her 13 minutes
Unfortunately, I was off by 1 minute
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
When I told her,
She said, "You timed that?"
I was curious about my average shower time.
Then she instantly changed the topic
Now I’m talking to Jiyeon unnie
I’ll listen to their conversation and try to sleep now…
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ
Hehe
Good nightㅏ
Eat something delicious and refreshing tomorrow
See you tomorrow
