🫧 최애 베라는 머야?

배라는 음
엄마는외계인 뉴치케 요거트 아봉봉 오레오
블랙 소르베 맛있는데
전에 콘으로 먹다가
흰옷에 그대로 엎어버려서
그 이후로는 집에서만 먹거나
안 먹어…
옷이 진짜
1초만에 검은색이 됐었어
………
심지어 인생네컷 찍으러 가는 길에
그랬어서……
겉옷 입고 찍었던 기억이……
슈팅스타.. 이상한나라의솜사탕..
먹긴 하는데
찾아먹진 않아
내 픽보단
동생픽 느낌..?
민초도 찾진 않지만 먹을 순 있어
🫧 동생 있었어..?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
이거 말 안했었어
히히
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
있긴 행
`~~~~~~~`
🫧 빈이 외동인줄

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 남동생?? 여동생??

둘다!!
🫧 동생도 노잼드립듣는거야..? 불쌍해

?아니
뭔소리야
어디가 노잼드립인데
설명해
^~^
🫧 동생들도 빈이 요리의 피해자였겠네?

웅
동생들이 나보다 요리 잘해
..
동생이 밥 해줬는데
난 까맣게 탄 쿠키를 줬었어..
동생이 먹더니
그대로 씽크대로 가서
뱉고..
노래 부르더라….
언니가 만든 쿠키~~~~~~
맛없지
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
그 이후로 내가 베이킹 해줄까? 물어보면
언니 저번처럼 태울 거 아니야?
안 해도 돼
……
애기가 먹어도 맛이 없다니…….
쿠키는 다시 도전 안 하려고 ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 빈은 다른 취미를 발전시킬까..？

…. 오케이
🫧 아냐 포기는 없어 파이팅이야 항상

웅! ㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 동생이 해준 밥은 맛있었어?

어 잘하더라
엄마 닮은 듯
🫧 빈이는 누구 닮았길래.....

JooBin's first time revealing that she has siblings ft. Joo sibs cookie disaster

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 What's your favorite Baskin-Robbins flavor?

Hmmm
For Baskin-Robbins
Mother is an alien, New York Cheesecake, Yogurt,  Almond Bonbon and Oreo 
Black Sorbet is also good
But one time, I was eating it in a cone and I spilled it all over my white clothes
So now I only eat it at home or I don’t eat it at all…
My clothes turned black in just one second
………
And this happened while I was on my way to a photobooth 
So I remember wearing an outer layer for the photo…
Shooting Star...  Cotton Candy Wonderland... 
I do eat them but I don't go out of my way to get them
It feels more like my sibling's pick than mine…?
I don’t actively seek out mint choco when I want ice cream but I can eat it
🫧 You have a sibling..?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I never mentioned this before
히히
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
But I do
🫧 I thought you were an only child

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Younger brother or  younger sister??

Both!!
🫧 Do your siblings also have to endure your no jam jokes..? I feel sorry for them

? No
What are you talking about
What part of it is no jam
Explain yourself
^~^
🫧 Your siblings must’ve been victims of your cooking too?

Yeah
My siblings are better at cooking than me
..
Once, my siblings cooked for me
and I gave them burnt cookies in return..
When they tried it
They went straight to the sink
and spat it out…
and started singing… <sup>[t/n: They were singing it like NJ's Cookie. Instead of "Naega mandeun kuki" ➡ "Eonniga mandeun kuki" ㅋㅋ</sup>
“Cookie made by unnie ~~ " <sup>[KR: 언니가 만든 쿠키]</sup>
"it's not tasty” <sup>[KR: 맛없지]</sup>
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Ever since then, whenever I ask if they want me to bake something
They're like
“You're not gonna burn it like last time, are you?"
"It's okay, you don't have to”
……
If even a baby says it tastes bad…..
I'm not gonna try baking cookies again ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧Bin,  maybe you should develop a different hobby..？

…. Okay
🫧 No, don’t give up! Keep going, fighting!

Yes! ㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Was the food your siblings cooked delicious?

Oh, they were pretty good at cooking
I think they take after our mom
🫧 Who do you take after, Binnie...?

A mutation... <sup>[t/n: It means she doesn’t take after anyone in her family]</sup>
