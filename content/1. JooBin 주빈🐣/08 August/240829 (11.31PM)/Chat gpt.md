**Translation:**

Big problem!!!  
What do I do!!!  
Come quickly  
Hurry, hurry  
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
I just called out for fun  
ㅎ  
Hehehe  
Huhuhu  
Hahahahaha  
Umhahaha  
You're coming????  
I brought a gift  
Oh well  
Guess I have to throw it away......  
💝🎁🗑️🗑️🗑️

Ah  
Should I send it or not

Poof  
✨  
Strong wind  
on the 24th filming day  
Snap snap  
Kinda like  
What? Meep? Meow?  
It feels like it will make these sounds  
Slightly  
I feel like I look silly but  
It's okay  
ㅎ  
🫧 Right,  

What do you mean "right"?  
;;;;;;  
![[240829_2.m4a]] No, it’s right  
I  
finished setting up the tent  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Alone  
For 30 minutes  
assembling and setting it up  
I haven’t slept in it yet today, so no sleep review yet  
But I went inside, and it's super cozy  
It’s nice  
Shinwi unnie saw it and said  
Wow... Amazing, I want something like this too  
But it's too flashy for me, so I’ll go with something like Soomin's  
And then she left  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ But actually  
It's not flashy at all  
It's just gray  
It looks flashy because there’s a big tent on top of an empty bed  
🫧 Did you put lights and a disco ball in the tent?  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Not yet  
But I plan to add lights ^~*  
Just like a mood light  
To turn on before sleeping while doing From  
That kind of thing  
🫧 Do the staff have behind-the-scenes stories from filming?  

Ah right  
They uploaded it!!  
Actually, I laughed a lot while watching it too...  
Ujeong-ing unnie made it so fun and comfortable to film  
She’s so cute though..... 🤍🤍🤍  
Everyone is eyeing the S25 spot  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bina, you’re good at touching dirt  

Thank you  
On today’s Signal  
I showed way too much of early morning JooBim..;;;;;  
When I can’t sleep at night  
My energy spikes………  
🫧 Why can't JooBin do a cartwheel?  

I couldn't do it even when I was younger  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I used to do handstands  
When my friends did one, I probably did about 10  
I don't remember clearly, but  
I know my athletic abilities pretty well!  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Can you do a forward roll?  

I can only do forward rolls well  
ㅎㅎ Heheh  
🫧 Why is Bina so good at everything  

..I can't do backward rolls  
^~^  
By the way  
In just two days  
It’ll be fall……  
Can you believe it??  
🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁  
No matter how much I think about it  
Summer still feels like it has a long way to go  
But when I think about the wind in Yeosu  
It kinda feels like fall……  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 It’s my birthday today  

Congrats!  
Dance for 10 minutes  
🕺💃🕺💃  
The dance of joy!  
🫧 My birthday is two months away, so I’m not expecting congratulations, but please dance  

Sure  
🏃‍♀️🤸‍♀️🕺💃🏃‍♀️🤸‍♀️🕺💃  
Ah  
I need to run the dryer  
ㅎ  
![[240829_3.m4a]] 🫧 Please imitate the dryer  

?  
I’m human, though......  
![[240829_4.m4a]]..  
Doing this  
^~^  
🫧 As expected, Bina is a genius idol.. good at everything except cooking  

..  
Thanks..  
..That cooking Signal,  
I don't know either  
I applied for it  
I applied.  
Did I not pass.........?  
Huhu  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I'm so bored  

Nod  
Oh right  
Last night  
I secretly sent it and left  
Did you see it??  
But you didn’t sleep much  
I was confused  
I thought everyone was sleeping, so I said, "Good night~~~~"  
But then  
What, why aren’t you sleeping  
Bina, you won’t grow taller  
They were all saying that  
;;;;;;;  
But I sent it and went to bed  
Before From today  
I checked WAVs replies  
And they all left warm messages~~~~~~ㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It was touching  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 키  
🫧 Everyone said nice things, huh  

What about you?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Oh today  
I had something to do with Joo unnie  
So Jiwoo unnie was looking for me to send a message  
She tried typing "Joobin Bin" but nothing came up  
So she was like huh…?  
She wondered for a bit and then realized  
Oh right, it’s "MyBabyBin"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I didn't change it, just left it as it was  
..🤍  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Bina, do you ever get hungry at night? Do you just eat then?  

Oh right  
My challenge to quit late-night snacks  
is over  
But that doesn’t mean I’m eating late-night snacks  
With my schedule, it often doesn’t fit,  
so I just make sure to eat meals well~~~~~  
🫧 That was a challenge...? I thought you just didn’t eat because it was tough  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Actually, that’s true  
I couldn’t digest well, so  
When I get too hungry  
I drink soy milk  
That much is fine  
So that’s what I’ve been doing  
🫧 Soy milk, like... Do you like soy milk? Lol  
Wow  
Not funny  
Okay  
I’ll try tomorrow’s meal suggestion  
Kimchi samgyeopsal  
What?  
Didn’t my recommendation go through?  
Everyone’s saying they’re going to eat something else?  
^~^~^~^~^  
🫧 Do you like banana milk?  

I love it  
The little banana milk bottle  
Banana milk  
Tastes good with anything  
🫧 Can you mix it with rice?  

? No  
Why are you like this  
^~^~^~^  
You can eat it with rice  
But mixing it… that’s a bit……  
Why  
It’s possible  
One bite of rice, one sip of milk  
What’s the problem  
ㅇㅋ Moving on  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  
Ah, I’m hungry  
So  
I sent a message to Soomin unnie  
Saying the part of today’s Signal  
was pretty  
I said  
Oh yay-ppeong  
Pretty  
But  
She said  
What’s "Oh yay-ppeong"?  
Oh Yes  
She was like  
She sent a strange message  
I couldn’t understand any of it  
It was like  
AdjuAhNoAyaNyang  
;/;7;₩3;  
Just like that  
She even sent a screenshot of a shopping cart  
..  
At this point,  
Isn’t this a note?  
🫧 Soomin sends things like that in From too  

Oh then it’s legit  
She  
🫧 Brush your teeth before bed  

Wash up  
Unexpected twist  
^~^  
🫧 Right before bed, Bina’s From becomes the main event, calling the fairy  

Long time no see  
🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️  
Whoa  
You didn’t call the fairy for so long  
It’s not even in my recent emojis anymore  
🧚🏻‍♀️Taking five questions now🧚🏻‍♀️  
I’ll increase it to ten  
🫧 When do you think you have to sleep to grow taller?  

I heard growth hormones work best between 10 PM - 2 AM, so sleeping during that time might help  
🫧 When you go to school alone, do you feel lonely without the Hanlim members?  

I go to school  
bravely  
🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️  
🫧 What’s your favorite Sanrio character?  

Pochacco  
And the one SeoAh Baby promoted  
HanGyodong..?  
Kinda  
cute  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
SeoAh Baby kept telling me  
Isn’t this so cute??  
So I was like  
..? Where is that cute…  
It’s just a fish….  
But  
I fell for it  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So I told SeoAh Baby  
She said  
Hehehe  
You’ve fallen for its charm  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 When do you think Bina will become a fun person? 🥺

I'm already fun, so there's nothing more to say🫨  
🫧 I'm going to Korea this time, any food recommendations?

Definitely kimchi fried rice..!!!!!!  
🫧 Who will you think of today as you go through your day?

You?  
Oh, typo  
Me!  
^~*  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Hehe  
I should think about [Y/N]~~~~~  
🤍🤍🤍🤍  
🫧 What do you usually do on your days off🫠🫠🫠?

I eat, sleep, watch movies, listen to songs, sing along  
And to top it off, think about WAV  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Any YouTube channel recommendations??

I watch too much mukbang  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What do you think about while watching mukbang?

Actually, I eat while watching  
So it's like  
"Oh, that looks delicious... *nom*"  
That kind of feeling  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Do you squeeze toothpaste from the front or the back?

..From the back  
🫧 Are you going to sleep now? Or not?

Soon, I’ll be dozing off cozily, dreaming inside blackout curtains✨✨  
🫧 Do you sleep on your side or on your back?

For someone like me who talks in my sleep regularly, that's a luxury question  
🫧 Do you sleep on your side or on your back?

For someone like me who talks in my sleep regularly, that's a luxury question  
🫧 When putting on shoes, do you start with your left foot or your right foot first?

For some reason, it seems like the left  
Honestly, I have so many shoes in my shoe rack  
I just wear whichever side I see first  
🫧 Is your right cheek softer or your left cheek softer?

From my perspective, the left  
🫧 When someone calls you, do you answer with "Hello" or "What is it~ Hey?"?

"Hello"  
🫧 Do you know it’s already more than 10?

Yeah, hehe  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Alright, I’m going to sleep
