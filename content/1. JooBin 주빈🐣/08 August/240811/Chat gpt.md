[Y/N] I'm here.
🫧 Why are you still awake so late!!!

Hmm.
[Y/N] Thinking?
 ^~^
 Ah, sorry.
I came after practice and showering,
so I got late.
Heh.
So, what were you doing while I was away?
🫧 Thinking about Joobin.

Nice try.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 How was your day, Bini?

😴🫨😵‍💫🙃
Like this.
Today,
I had mandu 🥟.
🫧 You ate me...?

?
I had meat dumplings
and steamed buns.
The meat dumplings were tasty.
I prefer meat over kimchi.
ㅎㅎ
🫧 Where’s my dumpling?

Ah,
it's still there.
Heat it in the microwave.
It's in the fridge.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You labeled it with "Bini," didn’t you? ㅋㅋㅋ

I labeled it as "Bini."
If I'm lazy, it's just "B."
If I'm just okay, it's "Bin."
If I want to be cute, it's "Bini."
If it's any of those, it’s mine.
🫧 Is "B" because it stands for "Babo" (fool)?

,
?
![[240811_4.m4a]]
Unbelievable.
🫧 I saw this and wrote "B" on my forehead.

Are you going to call me a fool?
^~*
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Make me yours~~~
🫧 Bini's voice sounds like a pretty girl in an anime who bullies the main female character.

So, in conclusion,
not a villain?
🫧 Right.

What do you mean "right"?
^~^~^~^
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 It's okay, Bini is the prettiest villain.

Awesome.
🫧 So, I'm talking to a villain, a dumpling, and a fool all at once.

Kinda cool, right?
🫧 That's cool...?

Just say it is.
Yes, thank you. ㅎㅎ
🫧 Bina, what are you doing tomorrow?

Thinking of you?
Going to work,
fan sign,
practice,
eating,
sleeping,
stuff like that.
🫧 Give me a lunch recommendation for tomorrow.

Lunch recommendation? Real braised beef?
Just kidding.
Sweet and sour pork,
cold noodles,
yukhoe (raw beef),
maybe one of these.
ㅎㅎ
Gimbap, pickles, tanghulu?
Never tried it.
Is it good?
??
🫧 Gimbap, pickles, tanghulu?

..?
Even if I've never tried it,
I know it’s kimchi, pizza, and sweet and sour pork...
..it’s possible...
🫧 I should resist a late-night snack, say something to help.

If you eat now, you'll gain 1kg tomorrow.
ㅎㅅㅎ
🫧 I already gained weight, what do I do?

Unexpected variable.
🫧 Should I eat jjimdak (braised chicken)?

What is this,
did everyone skip meals today?
🫧 Hayoun bought an abdominal massager, have you tried it?

? What’s that?
Does it warm your belly?
🫧 If you eat a lot, it’s a gain because you only gain 1kg, so let’s order now.

No,
I didn't mean for you to think like this...
I've lost.
🫧 She bought a low-frequency abdominal massager to lose weight without exercising.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
If that works,
everyone would be nothing but bones...
Tell her that’s my opinion.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Lately, I feel like I’m becoming more T...
🫧 You weren’t always a T?

Hmm.
..
I may look like this,
but I'm an F person.
🫧 Did you know? Real T's don’t even think they’re becoming T.

Oh.
I guess I'm not.
Phew.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Is that F-killer?
Everyone says the same thing.
Talking about F-killer,
then changing the topic to mosquitoes.
Our brains are connected,
= WAVE ^~^~^~^
Let’s become one~~~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I bet there are people calling her Gong Yubin (shared Joobin) after seeing Gong Yoo (shared room).

Correct.
ㅎㅎ They look for Yubin unnie a lot.
🫧 I need to escape from here.

Once you're in,
you can't leave ^~^~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Are you sleepy?????
Are you sleepy???????
Actually, no one said they were sleepy.
I just asked.
Don’t just say yes.
I caught you.
🫧 Bini, you're sleepy, right?

?
What is this?
Accurate.
🫧 Bina, tell me a fun story.

I don’t have many fun stories
in my life..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Even bumping your knees can be fun. You probably got hurt a lot when you were young.

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I fell down the stairs a lot
when I was young...
Once, on a rainy day,
I was holding an umbrella and wearing a bag,
walking home from school,
I slipped on the rainwater,
and I rolled down a whole flight of stairs.
In that moment, I thought
about all the scenes of my life passing by,
I thought I was going to die.
ㅎㅎㅎ
And I thought, "Ah, I can't go like this."
But I survived! ㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It's okay,
you survived and became a member of tripleS.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Yoohoo~~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋNever dieㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Since then, you've been careful, right?

Yes, especially on stairs.
🫧 JooBin accidentㅋㅋㅋ

A real "accident."
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
No, I'm not sleeping yet.
I’m thinking about what to talk about.
I’m also
waiting in the group chat queue.
Half seems to be in Torne unnie’s queue.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Bini, is there a challenge you want to do?

Oh, the
challenges.. I save them,
and when I see the content team staff,
I ask, "Can I film this?!!"
..I have 3 of the same requests piled up.
...Ah.
We have 24 members, right..?
ㅎ
...
Like that.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
So,
should I make one myself?
Seriously considering it.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋJooman challenge
A challenge made by Joobin✨✨✨✨
I'll take suggestions.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
B-side track challenge??
Okay.
ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 How about doing a challenge with the members after Joomansa?

Oh,
sounds good.
I'll seriously try it.
I really wrote it down in my notes.
Oh, right, I have to observe.
Almost forgot my duty.
I’m going to sleep now.
How is it?
Is it a good idea?
Yes, I think so too.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
He
Goodnight.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
