🫧 빈아 재밌는 얘기해줘

내 인생에 재밌는 이야기가
별로업서..
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 무릎 부딪히는것도 재밌어 어릴때 많이 다쳤을꺼같은데

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
어릴 때 계단에서
많이 굴렀어……
한 번은 비오는 날
우산 들고 가방 메고
학교 끝나서 집 가는데
빗물에 미끄러진거야
그래서 진짜 층 하나 전체를
굴렀어
구르는 순간 드는 생각
모든 장면들이 주마등처럼 스쳐 지나가고
죽는 줄 알았ㅇ
ㅎㅎㅎ
그리고 속으로 아.. 이렇게는 안되는데..
라고 생각하며
결국 살았어요! ㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
괜차나
살아서 트리플에스 됐잖아
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
유후~~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ네버다이ㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Destined to be a tripleS member — Girls' "𝗡𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗶𝗲" indeed

#JooBin #주빈

🫧 Bin, tell us something funny

My life doesn’t really have many fun stories...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 Even bumping your knee is funny. I bet you got hurt a lot when you were young 

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
When I was young
I used to tumble down the stairs a lot……  
One time, it was raining 
and I was carrying an umbrella and my backpack
Walking home after school 
I lost my balance on the wet stairs
and ended up rolling down an entire flight of stairs
As I was rolling, all my life flashed before my eyes
and I thought I was going to die...  
ㅎㅎㅎ  
But then I thought "Ahh I can't go like this"
But I survived! ㅎㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It's okay
I survived and became a member of tripleS
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Yoohoo~~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋNever dieㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

The long queue for the official SNS post and the overlapping TikTok challenges filmed by the members

#JooBin #주빈

`[Stopped chatting for 3 mins..]`
No, I’m not asleep yet 
I’m just thinking about what to talk about
Actually, I’m also in the queue for the official SNS post
Half of it is just Tone unnie  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 Bin, is there any challenge you want to do?

Oh that  
Challenge.. 
I have some saved and when I see the content team staff  
I’m like "Can I film this?!!!"
But they already have like three of the same thing backlogged...  
….Ah  
We have 24 members, right..?  
ㅎ  
…  
So then
I’m seriously thinking if I should just make one myself  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋJooManChal
A challenge made by JooBin✨✨✨✨  
I’ll take suggestions!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
A B-side track challenge??  
Okay  
ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 How about after JooManSa, you do a challenge with that member?

Ohhhh
That sounds good 
I'll really try it
I seriously wrote it down in my notesㅋ  
Oh right, I have to observe (the guest)
I almost forgot what I was supposed to do
