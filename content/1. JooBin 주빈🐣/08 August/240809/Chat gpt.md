JooBin's mukbang with her roommate Lynn and her first impressions of Japan

#JooBin #주빈

Are you asleep?  
You're not asleep  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 What are you doing right now? I just heard you're having a mukbang with Lynn

The mukbang is over
 Now I'm just lounging on the bed
🫧 You're tired, aren't you...

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I am but it's okay
So, I bought two ice creams at the convenience store
I ate one but I was so full that I couldn’t finish the other one 
So, I sent a message in the tripleS group chat
"(Ice cream pic) Who wants to eat this?"  
And it was taken care of right away
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 What kind of ice cream did you eat?

Crème Brûlée and Pino?  
Tone unnie and SeoAh finished them 
The crème brûlée was too sweet, so I just cracked the top a bit and ate the ice cream underneath
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I usually don’t like dalgona either but they said it was good, so I wanted to try it...  
Humans are bound to repeat the same mistakes but it's okay because I was happy in the moment...  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What did you eat for dinner?

Shabu shabu!  
But in Korea, the broth is usually seasoned but in Japan the broth was just plain water 
So, I was waiting and wondering if this was how you're supposed to eat it 
When I asked, they said you just boil the vegetables and meat and then dip it in the big bowl of sauce in front of you
It was kind of interesting 
Honestly, the best part of the shabu shabu place was the appetizer, the soft tofu  
^~^  
After eating it, I was like  
😱🫨🥹  
That was my reaction
JiYeon unnie and I were like 
"Wow, this is amazing. This is the softest tofu I’ve ever had in my life. It just melts in your mouth"  
It’s still shocking when I think about it...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie likes things made with soybeans

Today was my first time eating Natto
Not bad 
But I had it in a Natto kimbap, so the taste might be different if I eat it separately
🫧 You’ve eaten a lot in just one day ㅋㅋ

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Eating one bite of each is the best
You know what I mean, right?  
🫧 With 24 people, you could finish a whole chicken with just a bite each

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Correct 
🫧 How's Japan? Is this your first time in Japan?

Yes, It's my first time in Japan
I haven’t fully enjoyed it yet but the overall mood is just so beautiful
No matter how you take a picture, the scenery comes out so well
🫧 Bin, do you think it's hotter in Japan or in Korea?

So far, Korea...but it could change
Japan’s atmosphere is really nice
🫧 Come to LA ❤️<sup>[EN]</sup>

Definitely would love to🤍🤍<sup>[EN]</sup>  
🫧 Who's your roommate in Japan?

Lynn unnie!!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
My real Japanese roommate
At the convenience store  
"Lynn unnie!! What’s this?"  
"Lynn unnie!! What’s that?"  
"Lynn unnie!! What’s tasty?"  
"Lynn unnie!! How about this?"  
I called her a hundred times...ㅎ

`🐣How is it? Doesn’t it sound like I’m good at Japanese?`
`🦈So in Korean you don't do that either` <sup>[t/n: Speaking slowly?]</sup>
