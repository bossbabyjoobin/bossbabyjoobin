빈이의 얼굴과 텐션…
그리고
알았어 스포는 안할겡 ㅎ
연지언니 썰을
저거에 한 15배는 더 풀었는데
분량 상 잘린 것 같소…

🫧 혹시 촬영 시간이 어떻게 됐어

JooManSa EP 4 BTS, Episode 5 spoilers and some classic YeonJi shenanigans

#JooBin #주빈


🫧 I haven't watched JooManSa yet because I'm saving it for later but can you share the key points and how I should watch it?

Can you handle it if I spoil everything?
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Key point
Binnie is getting tired and gradually losing her energy…  
And..
Okay fine, I'll stop. I won't spoil it ㅎ  
YeonJi unnie's stories 
She actually shared about 15 times more than what was shown
But it seems it was edited out because it was way too long…  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 Do you remember how long the shoot took?

I don't really remember
but I was fine when it started
By the end, my legs felt like they were about to give out?  
Something like that? ㅎㅎ  

🫧 Be honest, did you space out in the middle or not?

...I didn't 
Yeah, I don't think so
🫧 After shooting JooManSa, did you film the SIGNAL application shorts that were uploaded earlier?

I think it was filmed before
My energy was still okay there
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 Binnie, since we're talking about JooManSa, can you spoil the next episode?

Do you want to know a real secret?  
I've already filmed it
So, I thought the guest for episode 5  would appear in episode 4  
I had no idea today would be YeonJi unnie…  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 Then, the "K" you hinted at last time is the guest for episode 5?

Bingo... but the guest for episode 4 is Kwak YeonJi unnie 
It's also right
**K**wak<sup>[EN]</sup>  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  

🫧 Binnie, did you see the picture of you and YeonJi on cosmo?  
It's so pretty! 

The behind-the-scenes of that polaroid  
We took all the photos trying not to laugh  
Suddenly, YeonJi unnie said
"I've been thinking of this thumbnail!"  
And I was like "Huh..??????"  
"Bin-ah, sit here"  
Okay.. 

🫧 Isn't that from the ending in Ulsan?

Yes, that's right  
I turned around  
and burst out laughing
And went like
Ahhhㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
Then I told myself "Focus, you can do this"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
