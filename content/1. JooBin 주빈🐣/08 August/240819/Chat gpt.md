Have you been well?!  
Hehe  
🫧 Did you pass out right after yesterday? ㅋㅋㅋ

Yeahㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I knocked out immediately  
Oh right  
I wanted to say something  
Thank you for always being by my side when I'm having a hard time or when I'm happy  
Today, too, I was able to get through the day thinking of WAVs  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 All of a sudden..?

What do you mean "all of a sudden"?  
Well, it is kind of suddenㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I was just thinking about this and that today  
Even when it's tough  
I try to hold on thinking of [Y/N]  
Thank you always  
And I love you so much  
🤍🤍  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 No matter what anyone says, WAVs are always on your side and always love you!!! We’re so proud of our Triple S S18 Joobin, and we look forward to seeing you grow while spending more time with WAVs. We love you!

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
I love you a lot too  
🫧 Is today emotional time for you?

Ah, no, I just got caught up for a moment  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Tomorrow, how about recommending something between breakfast, lunch, and dinner?  
How about bossam (pork wraps) + makguksu (buckwheat noodles)?  
🫧 Let’s eat the same menu together tomorrow

I’ll eat something healthy  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
WAVs, you eat something delicious ^^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Please take care of our health too

Okay, changing tomorrow’s menu to chicken breast salad.  
Are you satisfied now?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 How often do you have cheat days?

Well, it's less about having a cheat day…  
It's more about…  
A late-night snack day  
Like after a showcase, fan concert, or the last broadcast  
If everyone else is eating together and I feel like eating, then I eat  
But the thing is  
I should think about how my stomach will handle digesting it…  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I eat after thinking about that  
🫧 Was eating the lunch box that Jiyun's mom packed for you after a special event?

That was because I wanted to taste the sincerity from Jiyun's mom,  
So of course I ate it.  
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Ah, it was after the first Japan schedule!!  
First overseas schedule  
In commemoration  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Have you had any late-night snacks after eating Jiyun's mom's lunch box?

Not yet  
🫧 I’m thinking of eating a late-night snack now, what should I eat?

Yukhoe bibimbap (raw beef bibimbap)  
🫧 About food!! Were you able to taste the food made by the Japanese members?

ㅜRight, I also want to film Cooking Signal  
No, I didn’t get to taste it…  
I’ll switch it up to Lunchbox Signal and request it again  
Pick one member and  
Go on a picnic with my lunchbox  
The title would be  
“Which member gets to taste the wonderful lunchbox made by Cooking King Binnie??!!”  
Ah  
It’s perfect!  
🫧 *Binnie and I Starved l SIGNAL*

Go away.  
Naga.  
🫧 The member who got to taste the penalty lunchbox made by Cooking King Binnie??!

What now???  
No  
Not yet  
But seriously  
I haven’t shown it  
So that’s why..  
Really, really, seriously  
I want to film it soon  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Maybe you're coordinating the schedule with the fire station?

Ah-ha!  
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨  
![[240819_2.m4a]]  
🫧 Isn't there a reason why you haven’t filmed Cooking Signal yet, fairy?

🧚🏻‍♀️That could be  
🧚🏻‍♀️Here’s a question  
For a month,  
If you could eat only mint chocolate and cucumbers  
And endure it  
You’d get 5 billion won  
Would you do it or not?  
Oh  
?  
Everyone would do it  
That’s amazing  
You can eat either mint chocolate or cucumbers  
Both are fine  
🫧 So don’t just say it, give us the 5 billion first

Ah  
That wouldn’t be me  
ㅏ  
I heard this problem from somewhere  
I’m not sure eitherㅎ  
⸜(♡’ᗜ‘♡)⸝  
🫧 I’ve missed out on more than 20 billion won because of this

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
If it were me, I’d try it just for fun  
If I get tired of cucumbers, I’ll eat mint chocolate  
Challenge myself like that  
But if I do that  
I think after a month  
I’ll hate both mint chocolate and cucumbers  
…  
🫧 Did you tease the older sisters who started school, or not?

The problem is me too  
Except for Seoa and Hayun unnie,  
Everyone’s the same  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It’s coming up soon  
![[240819_3.m4a]]  
So, my pajamas  
It’s not pajamas, but just comfortable clothes I wear  
Did I mention it before? Hmm  
There’s something written on it  
Everyone covets it  
It’s a cute outfit  
Guess what it says  
Right, right, right  
🫧 Binnie, you fool

?  
No, wrong, wrong  
It’s  
“Gabojago!”  
Yeah, “Let’s go!”  
ㅋ  
And there’s even a speech bubble below that says  
“Haebojago!”  
Even the manager wanted this outfit  
I’m proud of it  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 It’s ultra-positive pajamas

ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Now, when you go to sleep, it’ll be “Jabojago!” (Go to sleep!)

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It’s a gift  
Honestly, if I didn’t have this, I wouldn’t buy it myself  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 It’s my first time seeing clothes more positive than me

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 There’s no “An Gabojago…” (Let’s not go)

…  
That’s negative  
🫧 Do you use a cute sleep mask?

Not a cute one  
But one that gives the gift of darkness  
Complete light-blocking  
Functionality is important  
Practicality⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
🫧 But you’re light itself, Binnie, how do you block it completely?

…That’s a bit overwhelming  
🫧 Isn’t it uncomfortable to wear a sleep mask?

When I wake up in the morning, it’s gone somewhere!  
It used to be really uncomfortable  
But after getting used to it, I found it rather comfortable  
But maybe that wasn’t my true feeling..  
🫧 Are the bunnies on your bed still alive???

Ah…  
Let me tell you a sad story for a moment…  
Dukki and Sekki…  
Had to flee to my hometown…  
It was an unavoidable choice……ㅜ  
Only one is left……..  
I have no choice…..🥺🥺🥺😢  
They take up space  
So they had to go  
What else could I do  
^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Right  
Hankki is a twin with Mayu unnie’s bunny  
It was the biggest of the three  
No,  
Mayu unnie’s bunny is  
A twin  
ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 How could you kick out the small Dukki and chubby Sekki in this heatㅠ

It’s okay, the air conditioning there is even cooler  
^~^~^~^~^~^  
🫧 Don’t your younger siblings covet Dukki and Sekki?

Actually, I gave them away  
I sent them, thinking they’d take good care of them  
Sometimes I get video calls to see that they’re doing well  
🐰🐰  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
1 minute left  
What do I do  
!!!!  
Oh no  
Big trouble  
Phew..  
Aaaah!!!  
Goodnight  
The first person to say goodnight on August 20, 2024, at 12:00 AM  
Is me!  
Success.  
![[240819_4.m4a]]  
🫧 I didn’t expect you to say goodnight

That’s my charm  
Unpredictability.  
🫧 It’s like you’re dropping a spoiler for something to be released

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
What’s there to reveal  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I thought something big was going to happen.......

Hmph  
🫧 Come to think of it, even though you’re not like the "world

’s best spoiler machine," you make sudden moves like you’re really going to spoil something, huh?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I got that nickname recently  
That’s new  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 S18 spoilers make me dizzy sometimes

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
As long as they’re effective  
🫧 Even if the spoiler is as subtle as a spider’s web, you’ll still get caught up in it! It’s Binnie-nim’s way

I’ll go to bed now  
I’m going to go “Gabojago!” now  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Bye  
Goodnight  
💕
