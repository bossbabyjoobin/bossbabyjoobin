Did you arrive home??
Get home safely~
🫧 Good job!

Thank you🤍🤍
WAVs worked hard too
In this hot weather
Cheering us on all day..ㅜㅜㅜㅠ
Even though you’re tired
It was nice being with WAVs all day ㅎ
Even though you were so far away that you were hard to see and hear
When you asked if we ate!!!!
You answered so loudly
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
If I didn’t understand,
You would use your body to communicate
I was a bit touched…
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 🫧 What do you think about Binie’s running skills being the talk of the town..? 🎤🎤

I don’t really know
To be honest, I thought I was pretty fast
Just kidding
ㅎㅎ허허헣ㄹ
I don’t know ㅎㅎ I’ll skip it
Did you eat well today?
🫧 I ate well

Good job
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Is it too early to recommend a late-night snack?

? You eat late-night snacks even later than now?
..??
Oh
I see
I thought it was the right timing
Since it’s so hot
Eat some ice cream
🍦🍦
It’s essential in this weather
🫧 Don’t get heatstroke.

WAVs,
Be careful not to get heatstroke either
🫧 I’ll only eat Binie’s love

..Okay
I’ll give you all of it~~~~~~~~
🫧 Binie, I feel like I got closer to you today

What? Weren’t we already close?
Was it just me?
……
^~^
ㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Binie, why do you drink water so noisily?

No,
I drank water gulping down
How can you drink water noisily?
🫧 Did you drink water five times? Noisily?

Your creativity deserves praise
🫧 Binie devours the stage, now devours water tooㄷㄷ

Wow,
A girl who even chews water
(noisily)
🫧 What did you eat today, Binie?

Today,
What did I eat
Bulgogi rice bowl
I ate
WAVs love…
I ate it….
🫧 My love?

How could I say no to that
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Joobin!! Joobin!! Joobin!!! Darling!!! Darling!!! Darling!!!

Why are you calling me?
WAVs, I’m in a serious situation now
I desperately
need
support
No
No
No
!!!₩!!
No
No
No
Why am I second place?
I always come in first place in these things!!!
I entered the tripleS group chat and got dethroned!!!!!!
Tonee unnieㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅡ
I’m sad
But at least I got second place……
I checked until 57 seconds on Naver clock
Switched the screen
Sent it at exactly twelve
I think
Tonee unnie’s phone
has a super-fast internet connection
Sigh….
🫧 Hmm no, you just can’t win

No?
I’ll aim for the next birthday.
Joobin is coming back
Coming soon…..
The next birthday is far away
It’s okay
🫧 Binie, congratulate me first on my birthday, I won’t tell you when it is

? What is it?
Happy birthday
I’m first, right?
Yay~~~~~~
No?
I’m just getting ready for next year’s birthday
Unavoidably
Of course, I’m first
!!
😊😊😊
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Awesome
🫧 Binie is making me age faster ㅋㅋ

Talking about age
Made me think of rice cake soup
I’ll change the late-night snack recommendation to rice cake soup
🫧 Thanks, I aged a year because of you

An idol who takes responsibility for WAV’s age
How about that
Ah,
Subtracting…?
That’s a bit hard…..
…
I won’t take responsibility for your age
Sorry
🫧 You keep changing your mind

This is all part of the push-and-pull
You know?
If not, never mind ㅎ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I only know Joobin ㅎ

Even better
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 By the way, Binie is kinda cute

You’re just realizing that now!!
You need to step up
I’m going to sleep now
Joobin💚 you should sleep soon too
Rest well
See you again
![[240805_1.m4a]] You worked really hard today, make sure to rest well!! Love you, good night❤
