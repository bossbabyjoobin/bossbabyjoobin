JooBin really dug her own grave, twice...

🫧 Binnie, what’s this YeonJi’s necklace incident?

Wait a minute
YeonJi unnie is right next to me  
...  
No, let me explain  
YeonJi unnie has this dog tag necklace...  
The one she’s been wearing ever since we first met last year
And then somehow, she lost it? or something like that
Anyway, in my memory, it was definitely a rose gold necklace 
with a square diamond or something similar
But when I saw her today, her necklace was different
So I said “Oh unnie, you changed your necklace?!!”  
Then YeonJi unnie responded
"? I’ve been wearing this one for months. I even wore it during VV promotions”  
I said “No, I didn’t see it during VV promos... 
But I’m certain you had a different one before that"
She replied “Even before VV, it was this one though?”  
Before VV promos, I spent a lot of time with YeonJi unnie, we ate meals together and took lots of pictures
So I started going through my gallery
determined to find proof of this other necklace
But guess what? It was nowhere to be found…?  
ㅎㅎ  
...  
I think it’s because Yeonji unnie shines so brightly 
that she naturally left such a strong impression on me without me even realizing it
Ah, unnie really is someone who lights up the room ✨
Just like this, you know? 
.....:  
`[VM: *Sigh* ]` 
Oh.. and about the bag...
So, you know that proverb 
‘If you stay still, you can go halfway’ <sup>[OG KR: 가만히 있으면 반이라도 간다]</sup>
<sup>[t/n: check the proverb `Speech is silver, silence is golden`, they have similar meaning]</sup>
Well, I couldn’t even stay still 
so I didn’t even make it halfway and I ended up with nothing 
.........  
The bag... I thought it was new, something I hadn’t seen before
So I said to YeonJi unnie "Oh unnie, your bag is so pretty”  
..........ㅎㅎ  
But then…  
“🦆 ?? YaAAaaH, I bought this ages ago”  
And Tone unnie, who was standing next to me said
“Hey, JooBin-ah, what’s going on with you!!! ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ”  
….
I’m sorry
If I could add one more excuse  
I usually don’t wear my glasses because I’m too lazy 
so maybe it’s my bad eyesight
I probably just didn’t notice
That might’ve been the case, don’t you think?  
...
🫧 You didn’t say that to YeonJi, did you? ㅋㅋ I’m 100% sure it would backfire

Ohhh you got it right
I actually said exactly that ㅎㅎㅎ  
Today’s definitely a
*Let me explain myself* day~~~  
ㅎㅅㅎ
🫧 Binnie, the more you explain, the more YeonJi gets hurt ㅋㅋ
