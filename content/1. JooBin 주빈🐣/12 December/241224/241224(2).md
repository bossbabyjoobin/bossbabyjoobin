How NXT celebrated their anniversary and NXT's response to Binnie's message in their group chat 

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

🫧Did you have a party with your NXT unnies to celebrate your 1st anniversary?

Unfortunately, we couldn’t because of schedule issues…..  
But we did something fun today
I’ll tell you later ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ 
🫧 You should’ve had some cake and chatted a bit

I can’t let this slide  
As NXT’s official lovely maknae
I'll send my love in the NXT group chat
No one is reading it 
It’s kinda embarrassing  
ㅋ Someone responded!  
Only Lynn unnie read it...  
I sent a hand heart, NXT picture and a message  
but since no one read it at first, I felt a bit sad
Then Lynn unnie read it and replied in just one second
“🦈: Our baby is so cute" 
"🦈: Congrats on NTX’s 1st anniversary"  
"🦈: Love you💕"  
Like that

ShiOn unnie is showering
and HaYeon unnie seems to be sleeping
Correction. HaYeon unnie isn’t sleeping, she’s just not reading it 
She’s always on Do Not Disturb mode
But here's the thing
When I contact her, unnie doesn’t reply
When unnie contacts me, I don’t reply
So our conversations are always like
“🦔: Are you asleep?”  
The next day  
“🐣: Unnie, are you asleep??”  
The next day
“🦔: Hey"  
"🦔: Are you asleep?”  
That’s basically it
We just contact each other at night whenever we feel like it
Just now, I didn’t even notice, HaYeon unnie responded
She sent me kisses and said thanks...
