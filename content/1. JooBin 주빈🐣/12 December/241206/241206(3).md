The story behind THAT selca, SooMin's Kitty Pajamas and JooBin's shirt that everyone wants

#JooBin #주빈

WAVs, I mentioned before that when I chat with the members
we often send each other pictures  
If you’re ever feeling sad, down or on the verge of tears
I'll show you a picture you can send
![[1733500902138 1.png|250]]
From now on, instead of ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
you can just send this picture
The story behind this picture
I was lying on the sofa in the HAUS living room
wearing the fish pajamas HaYeon unnie gave me 
My glasses made my eyes look smaller
What was it again? It remember it was a sad situation
so I sent this to SooMin unnie
Ah right, SooMin unnie unnie had told me she was bringing back JagaRico from Japan <sup>[JagaRico = JP Potato Stick Snack]</sup> 
so I sent it with a caption “Tears of being moved ㅜ”  
Now, you can use this picture for emotional moments
whether you’re touched, sad or down  
Use it anytime  
Hihi
🫧 Do you have a selfie for happy occasions too?

Tears of joy
ㄸ  
🫧 Binnie, don’t you want Kitty pajamas too? <sup>[Leopard print pj's]</sup>

… When SooMin unnie was deciding on those
she messaged me 
As soon as I saw it, I was like
“What is that…? When would you even wear that…?”  
“Are you planning to wear it to a convenience store, to work or as casual clothes?”  
“How are you supposed to wear that…?”  
But in the end, she bought it
and honestly, it looks great on SooMin unnie
🫧 If you send something like that, do the replies come with pictures too?

They sent pictures first
While SooMIn unnie was debating on the color of the pajama, she asked  
“Gold or silver? Oh, maybe white?”  
I suggested white, but she’d already picked gold
So I told her “Gold suits you better unnie”  
and honestly, it really did
🫧 But why did you recommend white?

Usually, I ask before recommending anything
especially if it’s not my style. I think about what would suit the person
But this time, I just went with my preference… ㅎㅎ
🫧 I want to see pajamas that match Binnie’s taste someday ㅋㅋ

My style of pajamas
Soft, fluffy sleepwear 
Sky blue color  
Loose and baggy
I’ll wear that to bed
🫧 No, something you already have…

Okay, fine. I get it ;;  
ㅋ  
The top has Alice drawn on it but it’s not in the HAUS
so I wear a short-sleeve T-shirt instead  
Even manager-nim said it's cute
^~^  
When the members saw it, they were like 
“What’s with the T-shirt?!?!!! It’s so cute!”  
^~*  
Did I not tell you before?  
I thought I did
It says **Gabojago**<sup>[KR: Let's do this]</sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
You remember, right?
`[Flashback from three and half months ago...(240819)]`
`[For context, here's the shirt. I guess this is what she's talking about]` 
![[8b8844ac-58aa-4381-935f-f2a871c56b8a.jpg|250]]
So my sleepwear  
not pajamas, just comfy clothes  
Did I mention it before? Hmm 
That outfit has something written on it
It’s the kind of clothes everyone envies and says is cute
Can you guess what’s written on it?
It's.........
🫧 Binnie pabo

?
Nope
Wrong
The answer is...
**Gabojago!** 
Yup, Let's do this
ㅋ
And there’s even a speech bubble below that says
**Haebojago!** (Let’s give it a try) 
ㅎㅎ Even the manager-nim wanted this outfit 
I felt so proudㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 So it’s ultra-positive sleepwear, huh?

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Now, when you sleep, it’ll be **Jabojago!** (Let’s sleep)

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It’s a gift  
Honestly, if it wasn't a gift, I don’t think I’d have bought it myself
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 I’ve never seen clothes more positive than me before

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Isn’t there an **An Gabojago**? (Let’s not go for it)

.....  
That’s so negative
