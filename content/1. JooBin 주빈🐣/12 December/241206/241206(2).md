Another victim of Kwak YeonJi's ear-piercing alarm has emerged

🫧 I heard about the time you woke JiYeon up when she overslept ㅋㅋㅋ

A few days ago, I woke SooMin unnie up  
Having four roommates is nice because  
we can help each other wake up on time
🫧 Wow, our Binnie actually woke someone else up?

Even I found it strange...  
Ever since living in the HAUS
alarms I couldn’t hear before  
started waking me up within a week…  
and now I’m the one waking people up…  
🫧 *How many alarms do you set?* <sup>[*EN*]</sup>

*Always three*
*30 mins before*
*20 mins*
*10 mins*
I need to wake up 30 minutes early to have enough time 
🫧 YeonJi uses those ear-piercing alarms. What kind does Binnie use?

For me
It’s just the basic one
“Diririririring... Diririririring…” 
Even with just that, it’s enough to wake me up
But YeonJi unnie’s alarm?  <sup>[VID below]</sup>
It’s practically from a horror movie 
Something like
“Jijijijijijik" "kkkkkkkkkk" "Kigigigik”  
It makes noises like that
