What are you doing?
Hehe  
Long time no see 
🫧 What are you doing?

It’s a secret but  
it’s cold <sup>[t/n: Hmmmm...🎬(?)...🤔]</sup>
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶  
^~^  
If I hadn’t worn my long padding today  
I might’ve gotten frostbite ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ  
🫧 Do you have a must-have winter item, Binnie?

I’m not using it now but earmuffs  
So warm!  
If you wear a long padding, a scarf, earmuffs, a fur hat, gloves and have a hot pack
You’re fully geared up  
That’s how you survive winter
🫧 Wouldn’t you get hot with all that?

Nope, it’s still cold  
You’ve gotta dress warmly ~~~~~~~
🫧 UGG boots and fleece pants ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

When are my UGG boots going to arrive?  
International shipping...  
It’s taking forever  
🫧 Did you wear your tteokbokki coat, Binnie? <sup>[t/n: fleece-textured toggle coat, mentioned in 241123 trans]</sup>

Yup  
I wore it on MMA day
🫧 You even filmed a challenge with Sullin that day

That’s right
Hihi
The day before, Sullin unnie said  
"Bin-ah, let’s do a challenge together!"  
I was like "Sure, what challenge?" and she showed me  
So the next day, we quickly filmed it  
Our chemistry name is **Sullbingz**  
Cute, right?  
🫧 Who came up with it?

It just popped into my mind 
*"Sullbin Sullbin.. Sullbing…??"*  
I’ll ask Sullin unnie about it  
🫧 Wait, are you *Bing*?

… I've been *Bing* from the start because of "BingSooOnDa"<sup>[name of their room before the OT24 shuffle]</sup>
I’m JooBing...  
Hold on  
Give me 5 minutes
...  
I came back in 4 minutes  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
Sullin unnie said  
“Ah, that’s so cute! I like Sullbingzㅎㅎ”  
🫧 Did you actually ask her???

Yup ㅎㅎ
She said she didn’t know what Sullbing meant so I explained it to her  
Then she asked  
“Are you eating Sulbing right now?”  <sup>[Sulbing is a popular dessert café chain in Korea famous for Bingsu]</sup>
I said “**No no. It’s our** *chemistry name*" <sup>[*EN*]</sup><sup>[**KR**]</sup>
"*Sullbingz, okay?*”  
Then she said “*Ah okay*”  
🫧 She probably still doesn’t know what it means and just said okay

… I guess I’ll have to explain it to her later while eating together
