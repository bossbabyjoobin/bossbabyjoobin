🫧 Binnie, what did you do today?

Today, I ate bingsu with the unnies 
and we chatted a lot  
SeoYeon unnie brought up the story she mentioned on fromm
It came up while we were eating bingsu
The pants incident... the heartwarming incident... 
🫧 The one where SooMin pulled down someone’s pants?

Yupp  
🫧 Why would she pull down someone's pants thoughㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

I thought "How could anyone come up with that idea?"
Anyway, earlier, while I was doing my skincare routine 
I was next to SooMin unnie
and I was singing that part from _Hit the Floor_ 
the one that goes "baram ttulko urin dalyeoga" but I was singing it slowly
<sup>(KR: 바람 | ROM: baram = Wind)</sup>
>"**바람**" 뚫고 우린 달려가
(We run against the storm) 
거칠게 좀 더 좀 더 날 몰아쳐
(Hit me stronger with the wind)

But I guess SooMin unnie only heard the word “wind” 
In just that short moment, she thought
"Wait… does Binnie want to go out for some fresh air? But there's no way she'd want to go out at this hour”
I was so surprised when she told me that
Then SooMin unnie said
“I must really be an N. I’m way too good at imagining things”
It’s been so long since I last ate bingsu and had a good chat with the unnies
It was so funnnn
