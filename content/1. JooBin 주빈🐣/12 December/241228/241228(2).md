JooBin predicts her roommate for the upcoming world tour and mentions what Sullin said about her on her livestream 

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm

___

🫧 Earlier on Sullin's live, I think she mentioned you...  
But I don’t know Thai, so ㅋㅋㅋ

Really??  
I should ask her
I’ll ask when Sullin unnie comes back into the room later  
She’s in the living room right now and I’m too lazy to go out...  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Are you inside the tent?

Yup ㅎㅎ  

`[5 minutes later...]`

I asked Sullin unnie
She said she often sees me because of Rolex practice before
and now for the world tour preparations
That's what she said earlier
I think my roommate is probably one of these three
Sullin unnie, SeoAh or HaYeon unnie
One of the three, I’m sure  
🫧 SulBingz, HaetKongz, Tom and Jerryz. Any of them would be good

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
If it’s none of them
then seriously, my hunch is...  
so unreliable...  
🫧 Is it just your hunch or do you have a reason?

It’s 100% just my hunch hehe...
