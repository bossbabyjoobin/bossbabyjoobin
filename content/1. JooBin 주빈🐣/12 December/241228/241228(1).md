WAV, what are you doing
What are you dooooing  
🫧 How about you? What are you doing? 

Lying down, on the verge of passing out  
🫧 Why are your Insta pics so pretty?????

Heh 
What do you think?  
SeoYeon unnie took them 
While taking pictures, she said  
“Bin-ah, your side profile looks amazing"  
"Look this way, I’ll take pictures of you"
And that’s how it turned out
Oh, and also, the reels I filmed are all getting uploaded
so I’m in a good mood
~~  
🫧 Is there a challenge that you want to try, Binnie?

Hmm  
But even if you save it (to film for later) 
The person who records it first is the winner
ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 Who suggested recording the "Wait" Challenge??  
It’s a combination (of the members) I haven’t seen before

Actually, I saw the Japanese version
the one that goes "Matte Watashi ga anata o" something something
and I really wanted to film it
So I went to Tone unnie and said
"Unnie, lets record this challenge together"  
She said okay but JiYeon unnie was next to her
Then JiYeon unnie suddenly did that “Wait ~ ” part <sup>[watch the tiktok^~^]</sup>
so I said "Unnie, we’re filming now, join us"  
And the three of us filmed it in a rush
But honestly, the original version was cuter
By the way, the chemi name is Healingz
a combination that makes you feel at ease..🤍
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 My heart is at ease but the video is pure chaos

It was on purpose
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋ
🫧 What is the chemistry name for you three? 
Aren’t both of you Kotone’s faves? ㅋㅋㅋ

Between Nupnupz, JooBin appears
🫧 NupJupz

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
