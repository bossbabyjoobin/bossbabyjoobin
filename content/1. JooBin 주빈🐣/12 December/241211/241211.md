What are you doing? 
🫧 You showed up right on Binnie Hour! <sup>(KR: 비니시)</sup> <sup>[t/n: her bday  01:16]</sup>

Oh wow  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I was checking out the fan club kit that just arrived!

Oh, you just got it?!!  
I wanna see it too  
I’m curious how it turned out  
🫧 How have you been lately, Binnie?

I’ve been having fun...ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I’m also preparing for the tour
Since all 24 of us have been seeing each other so much lately
it feels like it’s been forever
so I’m excited 
😛😚😚

🫧 Have you traveled abroad a lot, JooBin?

No, surprisingly, I haven’t been abroad that much
It's even my first time travelling in Japan before
and there are going to be a lot of firsts coming up
ㅎㅎㅎ  
I’m so excited  
🫧 What’s your wish for 2025?

First, I hope the tour goes well
and I want to spend more time with the members
like celebrating New Year’s and birthdays together
What’s your wish, [Y/N]?  
I hope all your wishes for 2025 come true  
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨  
🤍🤍  
🫧 My wish is to see tripleS ot24 ^~^<sup>[EN]</sup>

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
You’ll get to see us  
with Gravity and everything  
There’s so much  
Hihi
🫧 Did your UGG boots arrive?

...No  
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜNot yet  
For real, when are they coming  
WAVs, give me 5 minutes  
ㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I was just talking to HaYeon unnie
🫧 Recommend me something to eat todayㄱㄱㄱ

Okay  
late-night snack rec
Dakgalbi <sup>[t/n: spicy stir-fried chicken]</sup>  
Reason? 
It just popped into my head...  
Tomorrow’s menu rec
Donkatsu<sup>[t/n: pork cutlet]</sup>  
We’ve been practicing a lot for the tour
and I'm amazed by our members’ memory <sup>[t/n: prolly choreo memorization]</sup>
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Seeing my bias is a dream come true 🥹🫶<sup>[EN]</sup>

🤍🤍🤍  
🫧 I heard SeoAh’s been going around kissing the members... Has Binnie been a victim too?

Huh?  
Ahhhh 
I always manage to avoid it ㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Oh!! Binnie, has your MBTI changed..? 🤔

Nope!! It’s still the same 
but the percentages are different  
F and T are now 50/50  
The rest is the same  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Do you think you'll ever become an E?

Nope...  
If anything, being around the members lately has made me realize 
I’m definitely an I  
But I think I’ve become a bit more outgoing thanks to them
I’m thinking of changing my profile picture
What do you think?  
Just a thought for now `^~^`  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie’s the type to act on her thoughts anyway ^~^

...ㅎㅎ  
You did well today  
🫶🏻  
Dream of me  
Bye bye  
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
