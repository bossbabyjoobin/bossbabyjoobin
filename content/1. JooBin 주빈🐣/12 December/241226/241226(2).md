🫧 What did you eat today?<sup>[JP]</sup>

I ate something delicious today  
We went to a buffet and I tried a little bit of everything
Hihi 
Yup, I went with my family
🫧 You should pile your plate with lots of good stuff

But then you get full too quickly
That’s why I just took one bite of everything
🫧 What was the best one? What’s Binnie’s one-pick?

Steamed eggs
It was the best 
Yum
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅅ  
It was the softest steamed eggs ever  
That and pork ribs!!
🫧 Binnie, have you tried SeoYeon’s steamed eggs?

We don’t have a stone pot at our dorm
Do we?  
Actually, I’m not sure 
I should ask SeoYeon unnie to make it for me later
"Unnie, please make me steamed eggs too"
🫧 Is there something Binnie is confident in making?

To follow SeoYeon unnie's steamed eggs... how about Binnie’s egg roll?  
But if something feels a bit off while making it, it might turn into scrambled eggs instead  
But seriously, my cheese egg roll is an art  
Nobody but me has tasted it, so I can’t ask for feedback, but I swear it’s good
🫧 Binnie, you know you can’t convince us without proof, right? Words alone won’t work…

Wait, I have a picture of my cheese egg roll 
Haven’t I shown it before?  
...?  
I see
Anyway, I’m really good at making it
I’ll make it for you someday  
Look forward to it  
I said, look forward to it
ㅎㅎ
