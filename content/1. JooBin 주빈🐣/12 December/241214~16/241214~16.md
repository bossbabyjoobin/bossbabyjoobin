Can you guess why MODHAUS posted a JooManSa preview at 3 o'clock in the afternoon?

I'm excited to see what kind of SIGNAL will be uploaded tonight
🫧 Binnie, you're really good at playing push and pull

Thanks, Arigato, Xièxiè, Thank you<sup>[EN]</sup>, Khop khun khâ
🫧 Imagine if it’s not Binnie’s SIGNAL, how funny would that be? you’d just end up being someone who waited for nothing

ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ

🫧 If nothing gets uploaded tonight, promise to chat on fromm

Sure.. ㅎㅅㅎ

……….
I'm going to cry
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
……………..
(*Sigh*)
🫧 I guess you kept your promise to chat on fromm

Right.. This was all part of my master plan yesterday 
because I wanted to chat with WAVs today 
You know that, right………………..?  
…  
I’ll wait a little longer…  
Just like I waited endlessly for my UGG boots to arrive
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Actually, I was practicing earlier
The data wasn’t working
so I kept wondering if it was uploaded
I waited until practice was over
and as soon as it ended, I checked…
… But it wasn’t there?

Let’s just wait a little longer~~~~~~

No, seriously
this isn’t what I meant when I told you to look forward to something.
SecretBase from a year ago  
suddenly popped up on my phone…
…………………….
Watching it makes me cringe 
especially since I made a pronunciation mistake in the middle
and just kept going 
(*Sigh*)
