🫧 Bin-ah, share the story about being mistaken for a college student ㅋㅋ

No, that.. 
It happened during summer break
I was heading to school for a summer camp or something like that
I was wearing a white tee, jeans and carrying an eco bag 
Back then, I had completely straight black hair
While waiting for the subway, I was on my phone, and the lady next to me said
"Oh, you must be a college student~~ You're tall and pretty ~~ "  
I was like "Oh, thank you..!!!ㅎㅎ"  
But in my head, I was thinking "..I’m only 13 though"  
Then the lady asked me again 
"How old are you~~ ??"  
So I answered "Ah.. I’m 13..!!"  
She immediately said
"Aigoooo.. I’m sorry! You're so tall I didn’t realize...~~ "  
I replied "No, it’s okay!!ㅎㅎ Thank you"  
and got on the subway
But honestly, I didn’t think I was that tall back then...
I don’t remember
🫧ㅋㅋ What would you say now if someone asked *what grade are you in*? 3rd year of middle school or 1st year in high school?

"Ah, I’m in 2nd year of high school" 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Is your height the same as when you were in 6th grade? 

Uhhh no..  
I’ve grown about 3–4 cm since meeting NXT unnies, I think
Since joining MODHAUS, I’ve grown almost 5 cm  
🫧 I want to join too

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
Let me think about my height prediction
I think it’ll reach 172cm  
It’s just a hunch
If not, oh wellㅎ  
🫧 If it’s 172, that’s close to Lynn’s height, right? But Lynn is taller

No, I mean like in five years
I think I’ll be 172 then
That’s just my predictionㅎㅎ  
🫧 In five years, SeoAh will be an adult…

Excuse me??  
I take it back… in four years…….  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 How tall are you now?

I don’t know. I haven’t measured recently
🫧 Compare your height to your unnies one by one

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
