"I’m sorry but where on the earth did my UGG go……?"

`[She's been hinting at something coming before this, which is why the UGG boots she ordered are being mentioned here]`

🫧 Oh, those boots?

Oh, right
When are my UGGs coming?  
Ugh, seriously
When will they arrive?  
They’re still in transit  
Do you think they’ll arrive before Christmas…?
🫧 The UGGs are on a world tour

They’re doing a world tour before I am…
Since it’s international shipping  
I tried to mentally prepare myself… patience… endurance… you know...
But it’s already been two weeks!!!!!!!  
🫧 Since they’re UGG boots, maybe they’re arriving slowly 
<sup>[t/n: OG KR: **어기**적**어기**적 (= moving slowly) but OP humorously replaced it with **어그**적**어그**적 to match UGG Boots (**어그**부츠)]</sup>

...Why does that actually sound kind of convincing?  
🫧 Normally, it takes over two weeks. It took me three weeks to get my mouse

Oh, really?  
I’ll wait until next week then…  
🫧 Even if they don’t come, all you can do is wait

…That’s true  
🫧 Or you could call and speak in English

Hello this is joobin <sup>[EN]</sup>

Okay…..<sup>[EN]</sup>
I feel like it’ll just end like this
🫧 who are you~<sup>[EN]</sup>
