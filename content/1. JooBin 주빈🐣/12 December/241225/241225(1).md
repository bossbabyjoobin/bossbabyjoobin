Merry Christmas ❤️💚🎄  
Here's a cake and my selfie for WAVs🫶🏻
The cake
I ate it because WAV didn’t want to 
🫧 What did it taste like??

.. Just plain whipped cream… blueberries...  
Not really my style...  
I only took three bites...  
🫧  What kind of cake do you like?

I like tiramisu, cheesecake and strawberry cream cake 
ㅎㅅㅎ  
No listen 
I caught up on several days’ worth of sleep <sup>[t/n: due to tour practice]</sup>
I overslept and stayed in bed rolling around until 2 PM, just as planned
I intended to come here right away<sup>[t/n: on fromm to chat]</sup>
but I figured WAVs might be busy enjoying Christmas
so I held off
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
That’s why I showed up after WAVs had fully enjoyed Christmas
Wonderful planㅎㅎ
All the reels from the Christmas objekts filming have been uploaded now
Hehe
That day, while I was getting my hair done
I saw Nien unnie beside me getting the exact same hairstyle
So I said
"Whoa, unnie"
"Let’s film a Christmas challenge together later!!”  
And we did
Then YeonJi unnie came over saying 
“🦆: Yaaa Bin-ah!"
"🦆: We have to film something for Christmas"
"🦆: How about this? Isn’t it cute?”  
And I was like “Ooh, it's cute”  
So we filmed that too
