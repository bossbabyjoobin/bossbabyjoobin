🫧 Binnie, you're pretty good at acting huh? I had no idea you were doing fromm in Abu Dhabi ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
No, listen
There's actually a really apologetic backstory for that…  
Let me just apologize in advance… 🍏 
So, we were done with all the fun stuff and heading back to the hotel
so I thought I'd start chatting on the way
But just as I began... suddenly, we were headed to a mart
And in all the chaos, I was like 
*"Why is this happening to meeeeㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ"*
*"I literally just started chatting ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ"*
So, I was trailing behind the unnies in the mart while trying to send messages on fromm
Since I was lagging behind, they started looking for me
I was like "I'm here I'm here"  
Then sending another message, and another one 
"Binnie, where are you??"  
"No no no, I'm here"  
It was all so hectic…  
I’m really sorry about that… ㅜㅎ
🫧 How was the amusement park? You went to both Warner Bros. and Ferrari World in one day?

Hihi
It was fun, but…  
I saw SeoYeon unnie that excited for the first time in a year
She completely drained my energy…  
"🐣Unnie… why are you like this…" 
"🐶ACKKKKK!!! THIS IS SO FUN!!!!! Hahaha!! Hehe!!”  
She was like that all day
Our entire conversation was just that
.  
And SeoYeon unnie kept running ahead by herself
My stamina was completely gone
“Unnie.!!!!! Please go with meㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ
I was chasing after her like that…  
🫧 I heard you went on tons of rides?

For real  
I didn’t think we’d ride that many
I was like “We’ll probably go on five at most ~”
But nope, we ended up riding 25;;;;;
Our manager next to us looked so exhausted
…I felt sorry  
ㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Were there no lines or did you have a flash pass?

We waited in line for some but we also had flash passes
🫧 I heard they have the tallest roller coaster in the world there! Did you try it? 🫠🫠🫠🎢 
<sup>[t/n:❌ info, it's not the tallest but the fastest]</sup>

Nope, it was under maintenance or something
so we couldn’t ride itㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Bummer…  
I guess I’ll have to go again someday ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Are you good with scary rides, Binnie?

We don't even need to talk about it
ㅎㅎ
I’m not a fan of creepy themes, but…  
As long as it’s not a haunted house, I’m good with everything else
🫧 That’s so cool. I can’t ride anything at all

If you go with me, you’ll end up riding everything 
Why? Because I’ll convince you....
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
“Eyyyyy look over there, see? Even kids can!!"
"You can’t back out now. We came all this wayㅠㅠ Just this once”  
“Oh, how about we sit in the least scary seats? Sound good?" 
"I’ll even buy you something yummy after! Let’s gooo!”  
You’ll definitely end up riding it with me ^~^ <sup>[t/n: I'm convinced already]</sup>
🫧 And then I’ll casually drag you to a haunted house `^~^`

That's a bit...
I've been to a haunted house before twice, I think?
You know how the staff pops out in costume to scare you?
I always end up apologizing to them like 
“I’m so sorryyyyyㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ!!!!!!!!!!!! Please, I’m begging youㅠㅠㅠㅠ" 
"Just let me passㅠㅠㅠ I didn’t mean it, I swear. I’m really sorryㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ"
"ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Mommmmmmㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ”  
And yet, they still jump out to scare me
The betrayal
🫧 The haunted house in Badge War Season 1 was so funㅋㅋㅋ

Watching Badge War Season 1, I couldn’t help but think
*“I’m so glad I was in NXT...”*
Just a little thought I hadㅎㅎㅎ
But I did notice a difference between attractions in Abu Dhabi and Korea
In Abu Dhabi, it’s all about speed
A lot of fast and quick rides 
But in Korea, it’s more about that heart-dropping sensation
None of the Abu Dhabi rides gave me that feeling, at least in my experience
🫧 Binnie, have you been to all the amusement parks in Korea???

I’m an amusement park master ✌🏻😛
Draken was the most fun <sup>[🎢 in Gyeongju World]</sup>
It was raining that day, so the ride was shut down for like three hours...
We were just playing a waiting game, wondering when it’d reopen
And as we were walking by, it finally opened!!!!!  
We rushed over and got on and it was raining while we rode
It was seriously so fun
🫧 Who was your roommate?!??!

I roomed with DaHyun unnie  
Both of us were super quiet 
Yesterday morning, I woke up first and thought
*“Should I go grab breakfast? I don’t want to eat alone… Should I ask DaHyun unnie?”*  
Then DaHyun unnie woke up and asked me
“Bin-ah, want to go have breakfast?”  
And I was like “OMG unnie, I was just about to ask you the same thing”  
So we went and had a nice breakfast togetherㅎㅎ
Yum yum
🫧 I guess when you like someone, even your thoughts align

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It was so comfy since unnie was my ex-roommate before
Ex-roommate? Former roommate?
We were together in BingSooOnDa
Hehe
