🫧 Binnie, did you eat?

Yupp
But listen
I ordered a beef rice bowl, right?  
A rice bowl is supposed to have beef covering the rice, isn’t it?  
But the beef was like…  
just scattered here and there…
There weren’t even 20 pieces in there..   
The visual was shocking…ㅜ
🫧 A rice bowl with barely any meat on it

ㅜ  
So sad
🫧 Isn’t 20 pieces a lot though?

It's less than our members…  
🫧 Didn’t you say you love the toppings on rice bowls? But there wasn’t much today…

ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Yup, I only eat the toppings of the rice bowlㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ  
I was so sad today…  
But I have good news!!!
