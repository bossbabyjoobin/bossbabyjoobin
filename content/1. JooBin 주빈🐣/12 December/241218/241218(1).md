🫧 Tone sent the picture you took together, it was pretty

Hehe  
I don’t even remember taking those with Tone unnie
But then Tone unnie asked me
"Bin-ah, can I send this picture?"  
I replied "Oh right, we did take those"  
"Yup, go ahead" and Tone unnie sent it

🫧Binnie, are you still in front of Kotone?

Yupp!!

🫧 Do you like Tone that much?

Tone unnie is mine
 `#ToneIsJooBin's`
 ^~^

🫧 Make an acrostic poem with Kotone's name

I’ll give it a try
Ko  
Ko-chan mecha kawaii desu! <sup>[t/n: super cute]</sup>
To 
Uhh.. this is hard…  
I’ll ask Tone unnie instead
Ko(코): Konnichiwa  <sup>[**코**오온니찌와]</sup>
To(토): This is Tone  <sup>[**토**네입니다]</sup>
Ne(네): Yes, this has been Tone <sup>[**네** 토네였습니다]</sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
This is amazing

`[21 minutes later...]`

I’m on my way to see Tone unnie and Lynn unnie
But before that, I’ll drink some milk…
🫧 I heard you're giving Tone Dubai Chocolate ㅋㅋ

Yup  
I’m heading there now
`[VM: I’m going to see her]`
![[241218_JooBin_3.m4a]]ㅎㅎ  
I'm here
Dubai Chocolate delivery
Hehe
🫧 Can you do a mini JooManSa interview?

Okay
Right now, Tone unnie, Lynn unnie and Sion unnie are all here
I’ll ask each of them one question
`[VM🎙️]` ![[241218_JooBin_4.m4a]]`🐣: Alright, let me ask a question`
`🐣: Hold on. There’s an ASMR attack happening next to me`
`🐣: AAhhh seriously`
`🐣: Okay, here we go`
`🐣: Do you have any interest in appearing on JooManSa?`
`🦭: Yes, of course`
`🐣: Alright, understood`
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
They said it’s not bad
Even if you eat it again, it’s sweet 
Bye bye...  
Next, I’ll ask ShiOn unnie a question
`[VM🎙️]` ![[241218_JooBin_5.m4a]]`🐣: Thoughts on Dubai Chocolate?`
`🍞: It’s sweet `
`🐣: (Laughs)`
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It’s really sweet 
But seriously, it’s even sweeter than you’d imagine
……..  
If your blood sugar drops and you feel like collapsing 
Just listen to Girls Never Die
and eat one piece of Dubai chocolate
🎵We stand up even when we fall *yum yum yum*🎵
If you do that
You’ll become invincible
Phew...  
Now I’m going to drink some milk again...
