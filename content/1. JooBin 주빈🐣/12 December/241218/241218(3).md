The Horror brought by Xinyu's Durian Cake in MODU HAUS

#JooBin #주빈 #fromm
___
I’m about to try the durian cake  
It's Xinyu unnie's durian cake
`[VM: Waahhhhhaha]`<sup>(screaming)</sup>
![[241218_JooBin_2.m4a]]
…..  
Whoa, I just went and came back
It's not easy
………
🫧 Only Sullin thinks it’s delicious?

Yup…  
It's just Xinyu unnie and Sullin unnie…  
Now JiYeon unnie is about to try it
(*Sigh*)  
She’s still mentally preparing herself  
Xinyu unnie keeps saying
“No, It’s delicious~~ " 
"Just take a bite~ ”
The flavor is even more fascinating than the smell...
...I’ll spare you the rest (of the review)
JiYeon unnie smelled it 
closed it back up
and ended her attempt
(*Sigh*) 
I need to hug Chunsik now…
….  
Xinyu unnie’s taste in food…  
I respect it but it’s the complete opposite of mine
ㅎㅎ  
Still love her though
🫶🏻
This is tough  
Now SooMin unnie is giving it a try
She’s starting by smelling it
🫧 Are the MODU HAUS members trying it one by one? ㅋㅋㅠㅠ

Yup
SooMin unnie said she’d cleanse her palate with some strawberry flavor before trying it
She tried it
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
She only had one thing to say
“Not my style."
