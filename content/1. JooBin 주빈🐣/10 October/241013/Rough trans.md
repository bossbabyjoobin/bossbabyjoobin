Oh my gosh, I seriously just had a big cry after a long time. I cried a lot. Seriously, the 07 liners are no joke. Let me explain the situation—my head feels like it's about to explode.

1. Chaewon unnie tried to prank Sumin unnie, then met Kaee unnie and tried to prank her too (but neither fell for it).
2. Then, they managed to prank Yeonji unnie and Yubin unnie.
3. After that, Sumin unnie was frustrated that she got tricked, but found it so funny that she called Jiyeon unnie and me to prank us too.
4. While Jiyeon unnie and I were crying, Shinwi unnie and Nien unnie came in and got pranked as well.

...Seriously, I can't even describe what they did to trick us—it was incredible. At first, I didn't believe it at all and thought, "What are they even talking about? This doesn't make sense!" Then I ended up bawling my eyes out.

If my eyes are swollen tomorrow, it's all Chaewon unnie's fault. In conclusion, the ones who got pranked were Yeonji unnie, Yubin unnie, Jiyeon unnie, Nien unnie, and me. My eyes are already swollen now. It was so hot, and I cried so much.

🫧 Right now, Jiyeon is in the same state as Joobin... I'm a bit confused, haha. Jiyeon unnie and I got pranked at the same time and cried at the same time, so we're both just bewildered...

The funny part is, I don't even know what happened. I just started crying.

🫧 Why were you crying... was it a sad story?

It went beyond sad. I'm relieved it was all just a prank with no truth to it. Phew.

🫧 So this all happened on a Monday?

…I hope it wasn’t real. Please, don’t come.

___

Right now, I’m telling Seoyeon unnie all about it, haha. It’s Sumin unnie's time to shine. I’ve been trying to talk for an hour, but I was crying because I got pranked for an hour. Seriously, even thinking about it again is so funny. Let me change the topic.

___

So, here’s the story—Chaewon unnie called everyone together, saying, “Let’s just chat.” She called each member one by one. It started with Sumin unnie, and she was just shocked, like, “What’s going on?” Kaee unnie didn’t fall for it either. Then, they called Yeonji unnie and Yubin unnie, pranked and scared them too. Jiyeon unnie and I were the last ones. They told us it was like there was a burglar, so we got worried about whether everyone was okay.

We went to the snack house together, waiting there, scared. But then Chaewon unnie, dressed up like a ghost, did a scary prank. I was so scared, thinking something serious had happened. I was really worried, and then I got shocked and cried again.

Even though I thought it was crazy for her to dress up and do that, she had already told us about it. Now, looking back, it’s funny, but at the time, I was just genuinely scared...


[241013] 🐣💭 11:46 PM KST

Kim ChaeWon, the menace that you are

(The reason why JooBin and JiYeon were bawling their eyes out late at night)

#JooBin #주빈



Seriously  
Wow  
For the first time in a while, I cried
I bawled my eyes out  
Seriously  
07z  
It was no joke  
 (_Sigh_)
Let me explain the situation
I feel like my head’s going to explode  
`1.` ChaeWon unnie tried to trick Soomin unnie but then she ran into Kae unnie and tried to fool her too (but neither of them fell for it)
`2.` Then, YeonJi unnie and YuBin unnie got tricked as well
`3.` SooMin unnie felt it was unfair that she got tricked, but it was so funny that she called JiYeon unnie and me to trick us too
`4.` While JiYeon unnie and I were crying, Xinyu unnie and Nien unnie came in and also got tricked as well  
…Seriously
I can’t even say how they deceived us...
It was incredible………..
At first, I didn’t believe it
"What are you talking about?" "That doesn't even make sense"
 While saying that...
 …I ended up sobbing
 (_Sigh_)
If my eyes are swollen tomorrow, it’s all ChaeWon unnie’s fault  
In the end, the ones who got pranked were
YeonJi unnie, YuBin unnie, JiYeon unnie, me and Nien unnie  
My eyes are already swollen from crying
I feel so hot because I cried
🫧 JiYeon’s fromm is in the same state as JooBin's right now... I’m a little confused... ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

..JiYeon unnie and I got tricked and cried at the same time
We’re confused too……………
The funny thing is, I don’t even know what’s going on
I just started crying
🫧 Why did you cry....... Was it a sad story?

It was beyond sad
Fortunately, none of it was real 
It was just a prank...
 (_Sigh_)

`[39 minutes later...]`

So, ChaeWon unnie told the members "Let’s chat"  
and called the members one by one
Here’s the whole story
She called SooMin unnie first  
She was surprised and SooMin was like  
“What’s going on?”  
Kae unnie didn’t fall for it
Then they called YeonJi unnie and YuBin unnie  
and tricked them too  
Finally, it was me and JiYeon unnie 
They called us over saying “It looks like a thief broke into the HAUS”  
I was seriously so scared, worrying if the members were okay
So we rushed to Cookie HAUS together and waited
But while we were there, I was totally freaked out
Then ChaeWon unnie showed up  
dressed all scary, pretending to be a ghost?
It turns out it was a prank all along
But seriously, I thought something really dangerous had  happened 
and I was so worried when I got there
I cried because I was so surprised
I was wondering if ChaeWon unnie should even be doing something like that in a costume
but they said she already mentioned it <sup>[t/n: About the prank, well since they're the last one]</sup>
Honestly, thinking back now, it's funny...
but in the moment, I was just scared, seriously………….
