🫧 What’s going on, why does your voice sound so weak today…  

The reason is  
Umm, while I was sending [this] off, the car was shaking so much,  
so my voice also went  
Haa↗️↘️↗️↘️↗️↘️↗️ like this  
^~^  
🫧 Today’s concept is pure, right??  

I was a 'pure girl' today,  
Jiu unnie guessed it.  
🤍🤍🤍🤍  
I’m touched  
Jiu unnie was like  
“Binnie, you’re so pure today, seriously?”  
So I said  
“Gasp, that’s my concept today! The pure concept!  
Unnie is the only one who guessed it!”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Then Hayun unnie next to me was like  
“I knew it too, pure~ㅎ  
You talked about it in From yesterday.”  
So I was like  
“Huh, is this unnie secretly checking my From?”  
It turns out Wayb didn’t keep it a secret after all.  
🫧 Gasp, did I mention it and she read it??  

She’s the culprit, arrest her!  
🫧 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ But was that a secret…?  

ㅎ헤 No, not really  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 If you mention it here, it’s not a secret.. Good thing I didn’t mention Soomin’s gift ㅋㅋㅋ  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I sent a gift to Soomin unnie, but  
she didn’t check the message.  
So,  
I went to her directly,  
“Unnie,  
please read it….”  
And came back.  
🫧 How did she react?  

Her reaction was like “It looks delicious.”  
Because  
unnie is obsessed with Dubai chocolate lately,  
so I sent Dubai chocolate as a gift.  
And she said, “It looks delicious.”  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
No matter how much I think about it,  
after observing unnie at the dorm,  
her biggest interest these days  
is Dubai chocolate.  
So I ended up giving her that.

🫧 Give me one word that comes to mind right now.  

Thoughts.. ginger?  
? Why  
Is there a problem?  
^~^~^~^~^  
🫧 Haha, this is so funny.  

Oh geez, I unintentionally made you laugh again, haha.  
😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😚  
🫧 It’s fun.....Wow..............  

Give me a reaction.  
🫧 I lost my belly button from laughing, Binnie, hahaha  

...Let’s move on.  
🫧 Binnie, I’m brewing coffee right now. Want to drink together?  

I don’t like coffeeeeeeeee  
Not coffee,  
make me a strawberry latte.  
I’ll enjoy it for sure.  
Nom  
🫧 Are you eating saenggulsiru* again today?  

No, I ate it yesterday,  
I’m going to sleep today.  
🫧 Yeonji’s place is having a saenggulsiru party, Binnie, come over to eat.  

Huh? But this is my house..?  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Seoyeon unnie’s mom gave it to us ❤️❤️❤️  
Lately, it’s been a gratitude party.  
🫶🏻  
Thank you very much.  
We’re having a party at my place for the second day in a row.  
Yesterday, we had saenggulsiru, fig siru, fried tofu, fried sweet potatoes,  
and today we’re having saenggulsiru, Choco pie, rice chestnut bread, and chestnut butter sandwich.  
I’m still feeling the aftereffects of yesterday’s party,  
so today I’ll just serve Choco pie and rice chestnut bread and sneak away…  
🫧 Binnie, say “rice chestnut bread” five times fast.

Ah  
Sorry  
ㅎ  
🫧 Oh, finally found something you’re good at.  

..  
This was it, haha  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
Let me try again.  
🫧 Oh, finally found something you’re good at.  

? Finally?  
What do you take me for, ginger?  
There, done.  
Ah, I feel embarrassed, I should delete it.  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 Don’t delete it, I don’t want even 1% of Binnie to disappear.  

Too late, I’ve already erased 30%.  
Anyway,  
even though we haven’t arrived yet,  
they’ve been waiting at our house for 30 minutes already,  
trying to make an open run.  
That’s impressive.  
I just want to sleep right away.  
I’ll put the Choco pie and rice chestnut bread on the table  
and sneak into my room.  
Phew  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Who’s at that gathering?  

I don’t know,  
but I think Yeonji unnie is there.  
I think Nakyeong unnie will come too.  
Yubin unnie’s probably there too? Yup  
I think everyone’s coming.  
Sion unnie too.  
I’m gonna dive into bed now.

Yahoo~~~~~~~~~  
Now I’m going to sneak through the party and into my room,  
all the way to my bed.

Bye-bye-bye  
Love you

Goodnight
