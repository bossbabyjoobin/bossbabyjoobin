**VM**  
I rode my bike over.  
🚲🚲  
How’s my biking skill?  
Mastering it in 13 minutes.  
Haha!  
Woohoo!  
The last bike I rode,  
before the Signal period,  
was a Pororo bike with training wheels that I rode in kindergarten.  
After that, I tried to ride my sibling’s bike,  
but failed after 3 seconds...  
Oh, but if I learn it,  
someday,  
I could go to the park,  
let my hair blow in the wind,  
and ride my bike coolly!  
So I signed up with Soomin unnie, and there was a behind-the-scenes story.  
We only wrote our names on the application,  
saying we’d become bike masters,  
and when we submitted it,  
the content team staff and the manager  
thought,  
"Oh, they probably already know how to ride."  
They understood it as us wanting to perfectly master biking together,  
so they were about to just prepare the bikes without any further preparation.  
Then about 3 hours before the shoot...  
..???? We can’t ride bikes??  
??? Both of us can’t ride??  
? Yes!  
?????????  
We need to prepare protective gear quickly!  
They said that,  
and it was a funny happening~~~~~~ ^~~^~~^~^  
Haha, the content team staff were working hard, running around.

Right... Actually, when I successfully rode,  
I just needed to pull the brakes hard,  
but I was too busy riding to realize it.  
“How do you stop..??” 💨💨💨💨💨  
That’s how it happened. Hehehe.  
So, in the end, I stopped by just putting my feet down.  
And after stopping,  
while waiting for Soomin unnie, who was coming from behind,  
I realized, “Oh, this is how the brake works!” Hehehe.  
And in the middle,  
Soomin unnie kept saying something felt off,  
so she said it might be the bike’s problem  
and suggested we swap bikes.  
So we did.  
But even when I rode Soomin unnie’s bike,  
I zoomed away,  
and Soomin unnie went,  
“Oh, never mind…”  
and we swapped back.  
🫧 Did you know that the left brake is for the front wheel, and the right is for the back wheel?

Seriously??  
I just pressed both at the same time!  
_^^_  
🫧 If you pull the left one too hard, you’ll fly forward...

Phew, thank goodness I pressed both at the same time.  
🫧 I was surprised that JooBin has some athletic talent; she wasn’t like that with running.

Wanna know something amazing?  
I’ve gotten better at running...  
I think it’s because of the workout...  
I ran over 3 hours and 30 minutes ago.  
🫧 You mean your running time has increased?

? No, I didn't say that.  
The skill.  
I didn’t say a lot...  
I believe in myself.  
🫧 Why did you run?? Hahaha.

I just suddenly wanted to run.  
🫧 I heard you’ve improved a lot in cooking too, hehe.

Huh? Who said that?  
My knowledge about cooking has increased.  
My mom watched me cook through video calls and told me there were many things I shouldn’t do...  
So I learned a bit through that.  
Hehe.  
🫧 So your mom knows too.

Yeah,  
because I gave her that black cookie.  
So cooking is always  
my sibling's responsibility.  
I’m just  
the taste tester? Hehe.  
🫧 Doesn’t Bin also do some cooking while looking at recipes?

Do you think I’ll look at the recipe?  
Hehe.  
🫧 No, but if your sibling is younger, they might be babyish, yet they can already cook well?

It’s okay; they’re taller than me...  
🫧 No, what are you talking about? Bin is tall too.

I’m on the shorter side at home.  
^~^  
Oh right, I gave Seollin unnie a gift earlier.  
Guess what it was?  
I asked Seollin unnie,  
“Unnie, do you like mint chocolate?”  
And she said, “Yeah!!!”  
So I gave her a mint chocolate puff,  
a round puff with mint chocolate ice cream on it.  
She liked it so cutely.  
🥹🤍🤍  
Hahaha!  
🫧 Does Bin like mint chocolate?

Recently, I tried it again.  
I’ve confirmed it.  
If someone I love asks to eat together, I can eat it...  
But I’d never eat it alone...  
If Wave asks to eat together, I’ll have it...❤️  
What do you think? Romantic?  
🫧 How about eating together but you only get mint chocolate? Hahaha.

? Let’s break up.  
I tried apple mint too,  
but only the apple part was delicious,  
the mint part was...  
If we share the apple mint,  
I’ll eat all the apple part.  
Hehe.  
🫧 Let’s break up.

Haha.  
🫧 Let’s just eat a different flavor.

That sounds right.  
🫧 Let’s eat black sorbet.

That one’s good.  
Yum.  
Mommy’s avocado newchike oreo yogurt,  
those five are  
my all-time favorites.  
Actually, I can’t pick just one.  
If I absolutely have to choose one,  
oh, I can’t choose!  
🫧 I fill mine only with mint chocolate...

..? That’s a bit difficult…  
🫧 Bin, I also asked Sohyun about this... I’m curious, if you had to choose, would you kiss a member or want to be kissed? You have to choose, or the world will end.

That’s too extreme.  
I’d want to get kissed... no, do the kissing... no, get kissed...  
Hehe.  
Doing it seems better.  
Getting kissed could be once or many times,  
decided by the other person,  
but doing it is my choice, right?  
It’s faster to do it once and finish.  
🫧 Oh, that’s somewhat logical. Are you going to execute that?

? No.  
Actually, I couldn’t do it on Shinwi unnie’s birthday.  
Hehe.  
She’s right next to me now...  
It’s a secret.  
Haha.  
🫧 Does Bin talk to Shinwi often?

It seems like they talk every day in the living room.  
🫧 The living room feels like a meeting place? Everyone seems to be there often.

Correct.  
The living room is  
a place to drop by  
and say anything...  
🫧 Are there any members who sleep in the living room?

In our living room,  
the member from next door is sleeping. Thank you.  
.. She’s sleeping.  
Hahaha.  
Yeonji unnie  
fell asleep just like that,  
and in the morning,  
“???? Unnie, why are you here...?”  
“.. I think I fell asleep.”  
That’s happened a few times.  
🫧 Hahaha! Did Bin have members who slept in a tent too?

Today, Nien unnie came over and saw my tent.  
“?? Whose is this?”  
I said,  
“Mine...”  
And she was like,  
“Wow!”  
and left.  
I’ll take a selfie in the tent later  
and show it off,  
my cozy tent.  
🫧 What if the tent feels shy??

Then, well,  
there’s nothing I can do...  
Hahaha.  
🫧 Bin, what do you usually do on your way to school?

I listen to music while going.  
I play my playlist.  
🫧 Please recommend just one from your school playlist...

“Wait for a Minute.”  
🎵 Timing - Minnie sunbaenim  
!!  
It really gives off a cheerful vibe for the walk to school.  
I can walk brightly.  
But my body can’t keep up with it.  
**VM** [I'm sleepy]  
I’m going to bed now.  
🛌🏃‍♀️💨  
Hehe.  
Goodbye.  
Sleep well.  
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
**VM** [Bye bye]
