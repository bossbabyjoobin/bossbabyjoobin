VM  
Rushed here on my bike  
🚲🚲  
What do you think of my biking skills?  
Mastered it in just 13 minutes  
ㅋ  
Yoohoo!  
The last bike I rode was a Pororo bike with training wheels from when I was in kindergarten, before Signal. After that, I tried taking my sibling's bike but failed after only 3 seconds...  
But I figured if I learn now, one day I’ll be able to ride through a park with my hair blowing in the wind. So, I applied.  
There’s a story with Soomin unnie too.  
We only put our names down for the “Bike Mastering” application, and when we submitted it, the content team and managers thought we already knew how to ride and just wanted to perfect it.  
They were getting the bikes ready without any prep, until about 3 hours before shooting we were like,  
"..???? We can’t ride a bike??"  
Both of us??  
? Yep!  
?????????  
So, they were like, "We need to prepare safety gear immediately!"  
It was such a funny happening~~~~~~ ^~^~^~^  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 The content team was running around a lot getting everything ready.  

At first, when I succeeded, all I needed to do was press the brake, but I was too busy riding to realize.  
"How do you stop this..??" 💨💨💨💨💨  
So in the end, I stopped by waddling my feet.  
After stopping, while waiting for Soomin unnie to catch up, I realized, "Ah.. so this is the brake, hehe." Learned something new again, hehe.  
And midway, Soomin unnie said something felt off and thought it might be the bike, so she suggested we switch.  
But even after switching, I rode off quickly, and Soomin unnie was like, "Ah, never mind..."  
So, we switched back.  
🫧 Do you know the left brake is for the front wheel and the right is for the back wheel?  

Wait, really??  
I was pressing both at the same time.  
*^^*  
🫧 If you press the left one too hard, you'll fly forward…  

Whoa, glad I pressed both at the same time.  
🫧 I was surprised you're kind of athletic, though you weren’t like that with running.

Want to know something amazing?  
My running has improved… must be all this exercise…  
I just ran 3 hours and 30 minutes ago.  
🫧 You mean your running time improved?  

? No, my skill.  
I never said by a lot...  
Why don’t you believe me?  
🫧 Why did you run?? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

I just suddenly wanted to run.  
🫧 You said you've also improved in cooking, right? ㅎㅎㅎㅎ  

Eh, who said that?  
I’ve learned more about cooking.  
Mom video-called me while I was cooking and told me I was doing a lot wrong, so I learned from that.  
ㅎ히히  
🫧 Oh, so your mom knows too?  

Yeah, because I gave her one of those burnt cookies.  
That’s why cooking is my sibling’s job.  
I’m just the taste tester, haha.  
🫧 But you at least follow the recipe, right?  

Do you think I would?  
ㅎ  
🫧 But if your sibling is younger than you, aren’t they too little to cook well?  

It’s fine, they’re taller than me...  
🫧 But you’re tall too!

I’m on the shorter side in my family.  
^~^  
Oh, right! Earlier, I gave Seollin unnie a gift.  
Guess what it was.  
I asked her, "Unnie, do you like mint choco??"  
She said, "Yes!!!" so I gave her a mint choco puff with a mint choco ice cream drawing on it.  
She liked it so cutely.  
🥹🤍🤍  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Do you like mint choco, Binnie?  

I recently tried it again.  
Now I’m sure of it.  
If someone I love eats it with me, I can eat it.  
But alone, it’s a no-go...  
If WAV wants to eat it with me, I’ll eat it... ❤️  
Isn’t that romantic?  
🫧 How about you eat mint choco alone for once? ㅋㅋㅋ  

? Let’s break up.  
I even tried apple mint.  
Only the apple part was good, the mint part was... eh.  
If we split apple mint, I’ll eat all the apple part.  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
🫧 Let’s break up.

ㅋ  
🫧 Let’s just eat a different flavor.  

That sounds about right.  
🫧 Let’s have black sorbet.  

That’s good.  
Yum.  
Also, Oreo yogurt, a few other flavors are my absolute favorites.  
I can’t pick just one.  
If I had to choose only one,  
I still couldn’t.  
🫧 I could eat mint choco for every meal...

..? That sounds a bit hard…  
🫧 Hey Binnie, this is something I asked Sohyun too. Would you rather kiss a member or be kissed by a member? You have to pick or the world ends.

That’s so extreme.  
I’d rather be kissed... no, kiss... no, be kissed...  
ㅎr  
Kissing seems better.  
If I’m kissed, the other person decides if it’s once or multiple times,  
But if I kiss, I can choose.  
One kiss and done is quicker.  
🫧 Wow, that’s surprisingly logical. So are you going to do it?  

? No, haha.  
Actually, for Shinwi unnie’s birthday,  
I didn’t get to do anything.  
ㅎㅎ...  
She’s right next to me now...  
It’s a secret.  
ㅋ  
🫧 Do you talk with Shinwi a lot?  

Feels like we chat every day in the living room.  
🫧 Is the living room like a meeting place? Seems like everyone’s there a lot.

Correct.  
It’s the spot where people pass by and say random stuff...  
🫧 No one sleeps in the living room?

Once, Yeonji unnie just fell asleep in our living room.  
In the morning, we were like, "???? Unnie, why are you here?"  
And she said, "..? I must’ve fallen asleep."  
It’s happened a few times.  
🫧 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Has anyone ever slept in your tent?

Today, Nien unnie came over, saw my tent, and was like, "?? Whose is this?"  
It’s mine.  
She said, "Wow."  
I’ll take a selfie with it later.  
I’ll show you my cozy tent.  
🫧 What if the tent gets shy?

Well, nothing we can do then...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie, what do you usually do on your way to school?

I listen to music.  
Put on my playlist.  
🫧 Can you recommend one song from your school playlist?

Wait a minute.  
🎵 Timing - Minnie sunbaenim  
It’s such an exciting song to listen to on the way to school.  
You’ll end up walking brightly.  
But it’s not my body that’s lagging behind...  
VM [I'm sleepy]  
I’m going to bed now  
🛌🏃‍♀️💨  
Hehe  
Bye  
Good night  
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  
VM [Bye bye]
