*Tada, Binnie makes her entrance!*  
ㅎㅎ  
How is it?  
헤헤  
Got it confirmed by Seoyeon unnie.  
"Unnie, how does this look?"  
Got the okay and sent it.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 As expected, Seoyeon has great taste.  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Come to think of it, I've been with Seoyeon every day lately because of events.  

That's right.  
I also keep seeing Jiwoo unnie and DaHyun unnie all the time.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I think this is my first time seeing a large four-cut of Binnie.  

Correct.  
I tend to prefer the smaller four-cut photos.  
But those are two large cuts, though.  
^~^  
🫧 Maybe I like short Binnie more too? ^~^  

Sorry, it's no longer available.  
It wasn't available anymore.  
No, it's really not available.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I got so used to myself that I just thought, "Eh, it's whatever," but people around me were like,  
"Binna, why is your hair so long??? Did it grow longer?"  
And I'd be like, "Huh, really?? Nah, it can't be."  
Then two weeks later, I looked in the mirror and was like,  
"Oh wow, it really did..."  
Same with my height. People said I grew taller, but I didn't notice and was like, "Huh, really?"  
Then a week later, I felt it.  
🫧 So, does it touch the floor now?  

Challenge! Rapunzel!  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binna, go for 175 cm too!  

Are you telling me to be the tallest in tripleS or what?  
^~*  
Still far from it.  
I'm like... 5th place right now.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Okay, I'll try climbing up...!  
🫧 I'll increase my height too~  

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Binnie started watching Black and White Chef and tries to avoid spoilers from WAVs

#JooBin #주빈


You know, I started watching Black and White Chef and it’s seriously so much fun <sup>[Culinary Class Wars (Netflix)]</sup>
No spoilers!  <sup>[t/n: Season 1 ended yesterday]</sup>
If you spoil it  
I’m throwing my phone  
Throwing it in 3 2 1
`[VM1 Below]` <sup>(She's actually so funny, it really sounded like she threw her phone😂😭)</sup>
I threw it
🫧 I’m hungry after watching Black and White Chef. Is that considered a spoiler?

? That’s just an excuse 
But WAVs, I’m touched
No spoilers at all...  
You're just saying weird stuff...  
ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ  
🥹😚😚😚😚  
You’re really good people..
I’m moved
`[VM2 Below] (Chcek it out, it's aegyo basically)`
You didn’t even watch it?
You were just teasing me?  
Come here <sup>[t/n: like picking a fightㅋㅋ]</sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Phew
What a relief ㅎ  
🫧 Who’s your pick on Black and White Chef?

Paik Jong-won <sup>[One of the judges in the show]</sup>
🫧 JooBin-ssi, come on down~

I don’t think I could ever show my cooking  
I'm afraid, I’d probably get scolded  
So before that happens, I’ll quickly eat it myself
Nom 
Shoong   
*Gulp*  
🫧 ?? : (*Sigh*)... Come here, is this how it’s supposed to be done? <sup>[t/n: Written in dialect to match Paik Jong-won's way of speaking]</sup>

I’m sorry……  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋ  
🫧 Binnie, have you ever tried steamed tangerines? ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ

???? What’s steamed tangerines?  
Not oysters but tangerines??  <sup>[귤 = Tangerine | 굴 = Oyster]</sup>
You steam tangerines??  
Oh wow
Is it like grilling tangerines?  
🫧 I was just as shocked when I first heard about grilled pineapples

But it’s actually delicious though
Nyam
🫧 Grilled bananas are delicious

Grilled bananas?  
Honestly, whenever you heat up fruits
I think it taste sweeter
You know what I mean?

🫧 빈아 만약에 빈이가 면허 따면 조수석에 누구 태우고 싶어??

JooBin's potential ride-along if she gets her driver's license

(she cooked YeonJi with this one not gonna lie🤣)

#JooBin #주빈

<br> 

🫧 Bin-ah, when you get your driver's license, who would you want in the passenger seat?

Ohhh 
I would take YeonJi unnie and go through a drive-thru  
I wouldn't even need to play music since I have a human radio next to me...  
Or... maybe that’s a bit much for a beginner driver?
In that case, I’ll take JiYeon unnie instead
I would probably say
"Unnie, is this the right road?!?!"  
"This is the right direction, right?!?!?!"  
"Or is it not?!?!"  
I should get driving lessons like this
ㅎㅎ
