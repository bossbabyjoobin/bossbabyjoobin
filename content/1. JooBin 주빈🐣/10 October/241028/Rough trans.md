🫧 I really really miss Binnie 🥹

`[VM: 🐣 Miss you too~]`
There’s a way
Before you go to bed
Just chant ***JooBin JooBin JooBin Joob Joob Joob JooBin Bin Bin Bin Bin*** like this
Then, I’ll chant ***Babo WAV WAV WAV*** to meet you too <sup>[t/n: to meet in dreamland ^~^]</sup> 
How’s that?
?
Why?
ㅋ
🫧 What should I do? Since we’re *babo WAVs*, we probably won’t see each other in our dreamsㅠㅠ <sup>[t/n: b/pabo = fool]</sup>

I see
ㅋ
ㅋ
ㅋ
ㅋ
🫧 Guess I’ll have to start chanting ***Babo JooBin Babo JooBin*** too then

What? Are? You? Talking? About?ㅎㅎ
I have no idea ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ 

🫧 Babo means I love you

Of course, of course
hohohohoho
^~^~^~^
I'm planning to have FT <sup>[프토]</sup> tomorrow
It suddenly came to me
I should be a cool woman 
who shares her favorite foods with the person she loves
🫧 What’s FT<sup>[프토]</sup> anyway..?

Oh no, this won't do!! 
It’s French [**프**렌치, french]
Toast 🧈🍞🍳[**토**스트, toast]
🫧 Oh? I thought it was fresh tomato <sup>[**프**레시(peuresi) **토**마토(tomato)]</sup>

That's clever
🫧 Don't use abbreviations 😑😑

**오이안** 
Okay I won't use it from now on <sup>[KR: **오**키 **이**제부터 **안** 씀]</sup>
^~*
<sup>[t/n: OG KR: **오**케이 **이**제부터 **안** 쓸게]</sup>
 <sup>[She shortened her response to that WAV too, naughty Binnie ^~^]</sup>
🫧 Binnie, you’re so amazing~ <sup>[JP]</sup>

Thank you~~~~~~~  <sup>[t/n: KR - 아리가**'토네'** (Ariga**'tone'**) hence the mention of Kotone^~^]</sup>
I miss Tone unnie
I’m going to message her
Sent her a bear hugging a heart <sup>[t/n: Emoticon]</sup>

🫧 This stream of consciousness is impressive.

Enjoy your life~~~~~
Same vibes.
🫧 Binnie, when are you going to start wearing a winter coat?

Some members are already wearing theirs,
so I’m waiting for my turn.
Once like 8 of them start wearing theirs,
I’ll put mine on too.
🫧 Ah, I want some fish-shaped buns.

Red bean bun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But did you know that carp buns taste better?
???
They’re different.
Fish buns feel a bit lighter,
while carp buns
have glutinous rice, making them
chewy, sweet, and moist.
☀️
🫧 With taste buds capable of analyzing ingredients like this, why don't you… do more with cooking?

Shh.
That’s dif..fer..ent..maybe..?
🫧 Wrapped in paper bags, with snow falling, the vibes...

🥺🥹🥺🥹🥺🥹
🫧 For some reason, I imagine Binnie wearing boots on a lightly snow-covered day. It seems so cute somehow.

When I was younger and it snowed a lot,
I’d go outside
and sled near my house.
It was so fun!
[Y/N], I’ll take you sledding someday.
Look forward to it.
Wear protection.
🫧 Uh… I think I’ll just stay home and drink hot chocolate instead.

Oh, I make amazing hot cocoa.
Oops.
Hot chocolate.
Haha, my mistake.
All you need is
hot milk and powder,
it’s simple.
🫧 Adding marshmallows makes it even better, though.

Just buy the mix with marshmallows.
Haha
🫧 You have this way of looking like you’re good at cooking.

More like I’m good at preparing things.
🫧 Whether looking or preparing...

Dooly~~~ Dooly~~~
I’m going to sleep.
Before I do,
I’ll chant “Wave wave waebuyy waveii wave weaaevu wave wave wave.”
So I’ll see you in my dreams.
Sleep well,
I’m always grateful and love you.
Truly, good night ~~~
