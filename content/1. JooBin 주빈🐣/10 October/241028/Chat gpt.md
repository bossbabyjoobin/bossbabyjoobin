**WAVE**
I’ve been debating something for almost an hour now, but I finally gave up…
I’ve *pretty much* decided, though! But it's a secret 🤫 You’ll know soon, hehe

🫧 Did you seriously spend an hour on this because of a name…?

No, it wasn’t a whole hour just for the name, lol.  
I was planning to pop in at 11 and was glued to my phone, but I didn’t make it.

🫧 When will we find out?

Within 24 hours or so.  
🫧 Did it take an hour just to choose a picture?

Yeah, surprisingly, lol! There were so many. I narrowed it down to ten, handed them to SooMin unnie to pick three, then asked three unnies to choose one from those. Finally got it down to one!  
Ahh, relieved~ By the way, I had *galbijjim* today, but it wasn’t quite right. Next time, I’ll go back to the place I originally tried it. So for today’s recommendation: galbijjim it is!

🫧 Binnie, which do you prefer, regular or spicy galbijjim?

I prefer regular, boneless, and not spicy galbijjim.  
🫧 So you like boneless?

Boneless is the best—way less hassle.  
🫧 I’m about to have dinner now, wish me a good meal?

Who eats dinner at this hour? This is more like a midnight snack! Enjoy it!!

🫧 I really miss you, Binnie 🥹

`[VM: 🐣Miss you too~]`  
There’s a way to fix that! Just chant "Joobin Joobin Joobin Joobin Joobin Joobin Joobin" before you sleep. Then I’ll go, “Silly WAV WAV WAAAAVE” back in the dream. How does that sound?

🫧 Hmm, what if we’re too silly to show up in each other’s dreams? 😭

We’ll see 😂  
🫧 Then I’ll chant “silly Joobin silly Joobin” too!

Whaaaat? 😂 No idea what you mean, lol.  
🫧 It means I love you, silly!

Of course, hehe ^~^  
Tomorrow, I feel like recommending French toast to someone I love. Being a cool girl who suggests good food is my goal!  
🫧 “Futo”? What does that even mean?

Oh come on! French toast, of course! 🧈🍞🍳  
🫧 Haha, not fresh tomatoes then.

What a fresh thought~  
🫧 No more abbreviations 😑😑

Got it, got it~  

🫧 Binnie, you’re so amazing! 

Thank youuuuu~ 
I miss Tone unnie
I should message her
I sent her a bear hugging a heart <sup>[t/n: Emoticon]</sup>
🫧 Your train of thought is amazing.

Same energy as "Enjoy ur life~~~"  
🫧 When are you going to wear your puffer jacket?

Some members already have theirs on, so I’m waiting for the right timing. I’ll wear it when about eight others do.  
🫧 I’m craving bungeoppang now.

Red bean *bungeo*!!! But did you know *ingeoppang* is even better? It’s different: bungeoppang is kind of plain, and ingeoppang has sweet, chewy glutinous rice.

🫧 Your taste buds are so refined! But why don’t you cook more...?

Shh, that’s a mystery~  
🫧 There’s just something about bungeoppang in a paper bag on a snowy day.

🥺🥹🥺🥹  
🫧 I imagine you in boots on a slightly snowy day, so cute!

When I was younger, I’d go sledding outside my house after it snowed a lot.  
I’ll take you [Y/N] someday, so get your pads ready!

🫧 Uhh, I think I’ll just stay home with some hot chocolate.

Oh, I make the *best* hot chocolate! Wait—hot cocoa, hehe. All you need is hot milk and cocoa powder, simple!

🫧 It’s even better with marshmallows!

Then buy the kind with marshmallows in the mix! Haha.  
🫧 You give off a vibe of being really good at cooking.

It’s more like “assembling” than cooking, haha.  
🫧 Jo-ri-bo-go jo-ri-ba-do…

*Dooly, Dooly~~~* Okay, time for bed! I’ll chant “WAVE WAVE WAAAVE” before I sleep. See you in dreamland! Sleep well, and always know I’m thankful and love you. Truly, goodnight~ 🤍🤍🤍
