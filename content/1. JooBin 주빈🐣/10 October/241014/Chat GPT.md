Hey  
I just had some tangerines  
🍊🍊🍊  
🫧 Today's TMI?

I ate Jeju tangerines that Seoyeon unnie gave me ✌️  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
They're delicious  
Vitamin recharge!  
And today  
I ate something suuuper sweet  
Can you guess?  
Suming unnie, got it!  
Uh  
With Soomin unnie,  
Chaewon unnie,  
and Hayeon unnie,  
I ate it.  
🫧 Dubai chocolate?

Oh  
An advanced version of Dubai chocolate  
We had Dubai chocolate donuts  
But it was the sweetest thing I’ve ever eaten in my life  
My heart hurt after eating it  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅌㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋ  
It was way too sweet…  
The unnies all said it was really delicious  
And they're right,  
but it was too sweet, so  
I’m satisfied with just trying it once  
😚😋😋  
🫧 It was that sweet? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

It was like "mega sweet death"  
🫧 So, Binnie doesn’t really like super sweet things?

No, I do like sweet things, but  
this one crossed the line..!  
Try it once,  
you’ll understand.  
As I was eating it, I said  
“Wow, it feels like my veins are turning green”  
And Soomin unnie said she totally gets it.  
It’s true.  
ㅋㄱㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie is Hulk?

…?  
She goes “Huh?”  
💚🤢💚  
This morning,  
I had cabbage cheese grill.  
I ate a lot of green and orange today.  
Cabbage and Dubai chocolate for green.  
Cheese and tangerines for orange.  
🫧 That color combination seems familiar.

Isn't it just complementary colors?  
🫧 ビンちゃんがハルクになっても愛します … I’ll still love you even if you become the Hulk...

...  
Thank you...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I love you too 🤍

…Thank you, WAV...  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 It's okay, even if you turn into an alien, I’ll still love you.

That's totally Chaewon unnie!  
Squawk squawk  
Today’s random pick??  
I’m so full right now  
I already took some digestive medicine.  
🫧 Oh, digestive medicine, nice.

…Thank you for liking it...  
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Late-night snack  
Um  
Uuuuuuuuum  
Sushi  
🫧 Does Binnie like sushi?

I always order  
the bulgogi sushi set  
ㅎㅅㅎ  
I don’t eat raw fish,  
so I also eat inari sushi.  
🫧 Why don’t you like raw fish?

………  
I don’t like seafood.  
But recently,  
I tried scallops!!!  
And they were tasty.  
I also ate eggplant and mushrooms.  
I’m slowly expanding my palate.  
🫧 How about squid?

Squid is okay.  
🫧 So, Binnie is more about texture.

Bingo.  
🫧 So octopus and cuttlefish are okay too?

...Just squid is okay.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I can eat it,  
but like this 😖😖😖😖😖.  
I can only handle squid butter grill  
and fried squid.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What do you dip fried squid in?

Tteokbokki sauce??  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 It’s Monday, so you read a book, right?

Oh, right  
ㅋㅋ  
I’ll read it tomorrow, for real  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
This morning  
I left my book in the house…  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
I just put it in my bag after remembering now  
^~^  
ㅎㅎ  
🫧 I should read a book too...

Let’s read together⸜(♡’ᗜ‘♡)⸝  
Auto-complete kicked in ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Auto-complete is surprisingly refreshing?

Hahaha  
🫧 I want to meet Binnie, help me 🥺

There’s a way.  
Right before you sleep,  
chant "Binnie Binnie Binnie" ten times.  
I’ll chant "Wavie" ten times too,  
and then we’ll meet in our dreams.  
How about it?  
🫧 ?

?  
🫧 But what if a ghost appears instead????

Am I a ghost...?  
🫧 It won’t be a nightmare, right...?

Fine.  
I won’t say anything anymore.  
...  
🫧 …Don’t hang out with Soomin.

Earlier, when I was eating tangerines with the unnies,  
I sang a song with Chaewon unnie.  
Then Soomin unnie said,  
"Our Binnie wasn’t like this before…"  
So I told her,  
"Unnie, it’s all because I live with you now that I’ve changed like this. That’s why."  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 I should watch Binnie’s first day moving into the house again.

...That’s not allowed.  
Stop, you.  
🫧 Why didn’t Soomin become like Binnie instead of the other way around?

It seems like it’s easier for an E to turn into an I.  
But in my case,  
I become more like the E person around me…  
But when they’re not around,  
I go quiet outside again.  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 What’s your I and E percentage?

Not sure.  
I haven’t done the MBTI test in a while,  
but the first time,  
it was 89%.  
🫧 Oh, you should retake it—the questions have changed.

I’ll do it after I shower.  
I’m waiting for my turn right now.  
🫧 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ It’s higher than I thought.

It might’ve changed by now  
^~^~^.  
Shall I take it while I wait?  
Okay.  
I’ll do it on my iPad.  
By the way,  
I’ve got this three-shot photo with Seoyeon unnie and Mayu unnie in matching outfits on the clear back of my iPad case.  
Hehe.  
🫧 Why do only you get to see it? Show me too.

They’re my unnies.  
ㅋ  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋ  
Heh  
I’ll show you later  
Okay, let’s try  
Ah, wait a sec  
I need a charger  
Okay, I’ll try  
![[241014_3.m4a]]  
I feel like it’s not going to change, but I’ll try anyway…  
🫧 I guarantee it'll be T

That could happen, for real  
🫧 You used to make friends with new unnie(s) regularly

Not regularly, but  
All at once……  
Take a guess  
If it changes, I’ll reveal the answer  
But I feel like Soomin unnie is coming out soon  
This is too much  
Sion unnie came by  
She said she wanted to try the soy milk I always drink, so  
I told her to take it  
There’s a soy milk I always drink  
It’s tasty  
I gave it to Hayeon unnie too  
That soy milk  
🫧 Give me some too

I have 30 more, take some  
🫧 Throw it to me

Here, catch  
![[241014_1.m4a]]  
Did you catch it??  
Hehe, yeah  
🫧 Ow, it hit my head ㅜㅜ

..Sorry  
![[241014_2.m4a]]  
I blew on it, it should be okay now…  
I’m going to shower now and do my MBTI test  
Wait for me…  
I’ll come, but  
It might take a while  
You can sleep  
Good night  
We’ll see the WAV later  
Hehe  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Bye  
`[After 1hr and 17mins...]`  
Huh  
..  
My MBTI  
Result came out  
This makes it the 12th time I’ve taken it  
The answer is  
ISFJ  
..  
Still the same………….  
I’ve done it 11 times thinking it would change, but  
It never has  
………  
;;;;;;  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋ  
But  
The percentage changed a little  
F and T  
Are 50/50  
F 51  
T 49  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I is 84..  
Except for F and T,  
Everything is skewed to one side  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
People don’t change easily, huh  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Soomin unnie  
Is playing "Bbo Bbo Bbo"  
ㅋㄱㅌㄱㄱㅋㄱㅌㄱㅌㄱㅌㄱㅌㄱㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I’m laughing so hard I think I’m going to fall over  
Now we’re moving to the airplane

Phew  
![[1728919770500 1.m4a]] ![[1728919773117 1.m4a]]  
They said they’d close the door and bring the peak  
Please wait  
_^^_

…  
It’s still not over  
Please listen until the end!!! Hehehe  
🫧 Baby’s getting tired

Shh  
Heh  
![[1728920355528.m4a]]  
It’s Soomin, by the way  
I’m not tone-deaf  
I always play to weird rhythms with no accompaniment  
Then suddenly play a song, so that’s why  
I just tuned it now  
But my fingers hurt so much  
I grabbed the chords roughly  
So that’s what happened?  
It’s a bit embarrassing to play now, but  
It has that late-night vibe  
So listen to it as a lullaby  
I’ll start  
![[1728920360567.m4a]]  
They’re asking for one last chance  
I’ll give it…  
When will this end… please save me  
Hehehe  
I’ll try  
This is hard  
…………

….  
[y/n] I’m going to sleep now…  
Goodnight……  
🫧 It was fun

Thank you……  
I passed it on to Soomin unnie  
……  
ㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱ  
🫧 So, if you live in the same room as Soomin, you get these concerts every day…..?

……..  
I’ll move on without answering  
No comment  
Bye  
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
🫧 Experiencing Binnie for a day is tough, huh

………

Bye, goodnight

Hope you have sweet dreams listening to Soomin unnie’s guitar playing
