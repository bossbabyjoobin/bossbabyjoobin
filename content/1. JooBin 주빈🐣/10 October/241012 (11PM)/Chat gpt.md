Hah
I fell asleep like that yesterday
Opened my eyes, and it was morning
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Today’s the weekend, suddenly got a boost of energy

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
In an hour,
It’s the weekend
Yay
😚😚😚😚
I haven’t seen Signal today yet
Is it the Dongguk University Festival Signal??
I’ll watch it later
🫧 Binnie is at the corner, they say?

😉
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’ll join later as Joo unnie’s junior
I said it
Yeah, I told the unnies
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 What did Binnie eat today?

I ate something really delicious after a long time
Right away
Pork back meat!!!!!
^~^~^~
Yum
I had it for brunch
🫧 There's no way I’m passing up food like this

ㅌㅋㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
On that note, I’ll try food recommendations
Kimchi cheese stir-fried rice
How’s that
🫧 Oh, sounds good

Why’s the reaction so good all of a sudden?
🫧 I’ve always wondered, why do they put cheese in stir-fried rice?!

Huh
Cheese
Goes into everything
Cheese
Goes in rice
Bread
Pork cutlet
I think it’s right to put cheese in everything
🫧 They even say "cheese" when taking pictures

Right, right?
Put a question mark
^~*
🫧 Binnie putting cheese in soup dishes

They put cheese in spicy rice cakes too
ㅋ
I won
🫧 The era of cheese rice is coming

Cheese rice is my soul food
🧀🤍
Mix cheese, tomato sauce, rice, onion, and corn all together
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😋😋😋
It’s seriously delicious
Highly recommend
🫧 But you can’t cook

My aunt made it herself…
It was so good…
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I tried it once too, heh
But it turned out horribly bad, heh
ㅋㅅㅋㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
You know, I’ve realized something lately
When I cook for myself
I tend to eat less
So I thought a little
I should cut down on cooking
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Sounds like a good idea

..Yeah, thanks
🫧 Don’t give up, keep trying

Sometimes
You need
To give up
Just saying, heh
And
Watching “Black-and-White Chef”
Made me realize more
That’s what cooking is like…
Kind of letting go…
That kind of feeling?
ㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅅㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Excuse me… if that’s cooking, 99% of the world can’t cook

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
You’re right, heh
🫧 Evol’s 1st anniversary
What’s Binnie’s favorite Evol-ution song?

For me,
These days,
It’s “Low Fever 37.5” and
“WeWeWeWeWe~
Oui”
I like those
🫧 Next’s anniversary is coming up soon too

Can’t believe it
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Next debuted last year, right?
Still can’t believe it
🫧 If you had to pick just one tripleS song, what would it be?

“Do It”? Heh
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Love for Juppy

Web love 행 ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 So for Next’s 1st anniversary, won’t you have a party? Just the Next members?

Then we’ll celebrate with Sungsimdang strawberry shortcake
The youngest of Next has decided! Hehe
ㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It’s been 3 hours since I last saw the Next unnies
^~^~^~^~
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Wow, don’t you miss them?

Miss them so muchㅠㅠㅠㅠㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
3 hours ago
Shawn unnie gave me chocolate shell bread
ㅋㅅㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Frozen chocolate shell bread is tasty

Really?
🫧 Agreed, the chocolate flavor stands out more

Oh
I’ll try it
🫧 Do you know “Frozen Choco”?

Oh, I’m
A frozen choco master
Here I come again
Frozen choco expert here
I’m the best
Every time I go to the mart
I’d buy one frozen choco, share it with my sibling, and promise to be good to my dad to get it
^~^
I always made an extra one
And ate an extra one
I’d tell my sibling, “Look, I made this, you can eat it, right?”
If they fell asleep first, I’d sneak one away
That’s the true
Frozen choco master
🫧 Aren’t you just a K-firstborn daughter?

That’s the correct answer
Heh
But I think
I’m better at prepping food than cooking
🫧 Then Binnie should be the black-and-white prep chef

Yesss
🫧 Binnie, any weekend recommendations?
ㄴMapleStory
ㄴThanks

?
On the weekend,
Read a book.
Finish one chapter a day.
Because
I’ve started reading.
With Shinwee unnie,
We’re doing “couple reading.”
We randomly bought the same book
So we even took a couple photo with our books
It’s an English book
I got mine as a gift
And Shinwee unnie bought hers
She was reading it on the couch,
And the cover looked so familiar
So I said, “Wow unnie, I have the exact same book!!!”
It was crazy
And we took a picture right away
📸📸📸📸📸
🫧 Is it “Chicken Soup for the Soul”?

How’d you know?!
Haha
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
No, not a cookbook
ㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 What Korean and English did you teach Sullin today??

Today??
I did talk a lot with Sullin unnie today
We ate fruit together today
Sullin unnie really loves sweet persimmons
I had a Shar Melon
We talked so much, I don’t remember what I taught… heh
🫧 Did JooBinnie apply for anything on Signal?

Probably a lot
I applied with Sullin unnie for Signal
It’s a secret
Heh
I also applied with Soomin unnie and Jiwoo unnie
I even filmed it, heh
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’m gonna go watch Signal now
Actually, I’ve already started watching it
^~*
Bye now
Sleep well and see you tomorrow
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
