Hello WAVs~
I’ve brought a gift.
Ta-da!
Matching outfits with Jiu unnie 💚🖤
Haha, how does it look?
LOL
🫧 We look like sisters.

After we took this picture and showed it to the members and manager-nim, they all said, "You guys look like sisters!!!" LOL
🫧 We really do look alike, don’t we?

Even my mom says that when she sees Jiu unnie, she sees me. That’s why my mom likes Jiu unnie.
LOL 🫧 My baby JiuJuBin.

🤍🤍🤍🤍
🫧 Today’s live was total chaos.

Correct ^~^
I was in that high-energy mood two hours before the live even started, and I was worried I’d use up all my energy and be drained by the time we started... But Jiu unnie and Hayeon unnie were like, "Don’t worry, we’ll bring the energy up."
🫧 Out of the three of us, is Bini the quietest? LOL

I get drained the easiest... I’m the up-and-down energy person, while Jiu unnie is in charge of explosive energy!!! And Hayeon unnie is in charge of laughing until she collapses next to us.
🫧 Bini is so cute when she speaks Chinese 🤍

😉🫢 Thank you~
🫧 JooBin finally showed off her Chinese skills!

LOL, I showed a little (∩^o^)⊃━☆ﾟ.*･｡
(∩^o^)⊃━☆ﾟ.*･｡ Poof!
🫧 Why is Bini’s Chinese so good?

Not really... I just read it if you give me the pronunciation. I’ve mastered numbers, I can introduce myself, and that’s about it.
LOL
🫧 Did you learn it by yourself or did Shenwei or Nien teach you?

I started learning when I was in elementary school, and I was even the class leader in Chinese. But since I stopped practicing, I forgot a lot ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I should start again...
LOL 🫧 JooBin piao liang (pretty).

Thank you 😉
🫧 It was so cute when you were teaching Hayeon Chinese today, haha.

Before the live started, unnie asked me about it ten times.
🫧 By the way, how do pandas cry?

No way a panda meows. Hayeon unnie must’ve never seen a panda. They cry like, "Uwaaaah!"
🫧 Do a panda cry impression!

Wait, I’ll look it up. OMG, I found it. Let me try.
VM
It’s exactly the same, right?
For real, that’s how they cry. Look it up.
Squeeeeak!
Squeak!
I swear it’s real. Trust me. Just let me.
No, really, trust me.
🫧 OMG, it’s actually the same, LOL.

Right, right? Everyone, go look it up right now!
🫧 Whoa, it’s real.

Haha, I’m so proud.
🫧 I’m not sure if it’s close, but it’s definitely cool.

...
Have you never seen a panda cry impression before? Well, it was my first time doing it.
^~^~^~
Oh, I’m happy to be your first in this!
LOL 🫧 And probably your last^^

So I get to be both the first and the last, haha.
That’s actually good.
🫧 I’m not sure if it’s something that needs to be a first, but it’ll probably stay that way.

Yay!
🫧 I feel like I’ll hear that sound in my dreams...

Thinking about me even in your dreams? You’re flirting with me.
🫧 It’s kind of addictive, though. It keeps popping into my head.

? It worked? 🫧 JooBin’s been kind of funny lately.

VM
Didn’t you know?
🫧 There’s a meme of a cat that’s really popular in China right now.

Let’s change it to a panda meme from today.
VM
Instead, like this:
VM
How about it?
🫧 OMG, I love it!

Awesome!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
🫧 Bini, don’t leave ㅠㅠㅠㅠ

I’ll be going now.
🫧 Can you peel bamboo?

I could give it a try, but I’m not a panda, so it might be hard...
So, how about this timing for...
Yamechu (half-and-half noodles) with sweet and sour pork 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Amazing.
🫧 Jjajangmyeon vs Jjamppong?

For me, it’s always jjajangmyeon. Sometimes I crave jjamppong, but jjajangmyeon with jjamppong broth is the best.
🫧 Do you add chili powder to your jjajangmyeon?

My sibling recommended it, but I haven’t tried it yet. I’ll give it a go next year.
Oh, I wanted to recommend a song. What was it again? Oh yeah!
It’s been a while since I found it—Onochu.
🎵 "From the beginning, you and I..."
I listened to it this morning, hehe.
Now, I’ll go to bed while listening to this song.
^~*
