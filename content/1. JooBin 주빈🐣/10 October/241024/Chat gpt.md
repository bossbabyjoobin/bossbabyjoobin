Hehehh
Happy birthday, Jiwoo unnie~
😚😚😚😚😚
🫧 Binnie, I heard you got first place?

😉
VM
Finally
🫧 They said Jisoyeon yelled ㅋㅋㅋ

I really thought
I did something wrong
I ran from the bed
to the living room
Why…??? Unnie…??????
🫧 I heard you got first place because Shion sent hers at 59 minutes ㅋㅋ

But actually
Shion unnie is first on my phone..
I think my phone’s a little weird
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I don’t know, haha
🫧 Shion is in negative first place now

That’s nice
I’ll be somewhere between 0~1..
Even now
the VV unnies’ amazing stage
still lingers…
it goes round and round…
Hit the floor, hit the floor, hit the floooor
I added it to my playlist
And today, I kinda gave
wedding guest vibes
The members were like
‘Shouldn’t Binnie be going to a wedding??’
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 You and Shoni looked a bit grown-up together....

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋheh
🫧 Did you take a selfie by any chance? Hehe 🥹🤍🥰😍

No selfies, but
there might be something else
hehe

Ta-da
First
giant photo booth strip!!
How is it?
Hehehehohohahaha
🫧 If WAVs get married, will you come to congratulate us?

Just invite me, I’ll go
VM
I clapped so much
that I muted myself
🫧 But hitting your face must hurt...

No, not my face..
I hit the speaker
VM
Whew
Done
🫧 Binnie, recommend something to yell right now

“I’ll give it all ~~~ ” 
🫧  I heard Lin gave you a kiss?

What?
That’s a secret though
Did Lin unnie
say that??????
Sigh
Caught
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I don’t kiss the members first, but
Lin unnie was my first kiss in tripleS
ㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Lin unnie was like,
“You never kiss anyone!!
Did you kiss me?”
😚😚😚😚😚😚😚
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
She was kinda
really cool
I already knew she was amazing since Next,
but seeing her again today,
she was shining
✨✨✨✨✨
Maybe it’s because I saw her going through tough times,
but I wanted to support, comfort, and encourage her..
I thought a kiss would be the best 😉😚
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 Lin in that MV was seriously no joke...

Agreed
That scene where Lin unnie gets pulled by someone
then suddenly spins and dances with her hat
left a strong impression on me
🫧 Hearing this, I’m going to watch the MV for the first time now

What have you been doing without watching it??!! Go watch it now
You might re-stan
Be careful
My heart went boom boom
watching the MV
Got goosebumps
watching the stage
Got goosebumps again
listening to the song
Got goosebumps all over again
🫧 Pick your VV bias!

They’re all my bias………..
I’m too smitten to choose
🥺🫢🫢🫢🫢
🫧 Binnie, was the Shorts clip before or after the showcase?

The chat with Tone unnie next to me
was before the start!!
🫧 Did you wear high heels today? You looked much taller than Tone

No, it’s just my height
Haha
Sorry, just kidding
ㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I wore those heels today
and ranked second tallest in tripleS
^~^
So this is what the air up here feels like..
I experienced a bit of
the goddess-unnie life
Then I changed back
[DELETED]
Oops, sorry
Let’s pretend that didn’t happen
ㅋ
I changed again~~~~~~~~~~
Eh..?
That’s how it ended up
Tiramisu cake~~~~~
Tiramisu cake~~~
Sweet
tiramisu cake~~~~
I suddenly wanted it
I used to have this
delicious tiramisu cheesecake
cut into four pieces
when I was younger
My sister and I
would share one after school
It was really delicious……
Nom
🫧 You should try making it ☺️

I realized that
cooking... or baking isn’t really my thing
🫧 But you still do it...

To improve my skills ^~^
🫧 You don’t like coffee, but tiramisu is fine?

The sweetness wins over it, so I’m fine
VM
My love for
tiramisu cake..
🫧 Binnie, sing the “Pride and Prejudice” part for me

Is that Lin unnie’s part?
VM
My favorite part
is Jiyeon unnie’s part
Hosuuuu~~~~
백쪼
You know?
When I first heard VV’s “Hit the Floor,”
Jiyeon unnie’s part
stuck in my head
Umnyamyumyu.. hosuuuuu~~~~
No matter what I was doing
it’d pop into my head
It’s pretty addictive
Now I’m off to listen to “Hit the Floor”
Actually, I need to get up early tomorrow
for Changwon..
😉
Hehe
VM
VM
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please show lots of love for VV’s “Hit the Floor”
Bye
