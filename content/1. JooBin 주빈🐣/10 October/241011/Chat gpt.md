EN Translation:

Hi  
Came before bed  
Why aren't you sleeping?  
What's up?  
Good job  
Hungry  
But  
Brushed my teeth and put on lip balm  
Lying down  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Let's have an amazing breakfast tomorrow

That's the plan 😚😚😚😚😚  
🫧 Binnie, have you tried Sion's Dubai chocolate?

Yeah, I tried it  
I had some today too, Sion unnie did too  
🫧 She said you also had dark chocolate! Apparently, you were the only one who enjoyed it?

.......  
I ate it with a "it's delicious" kind of feeling  
But honestly  
It was... bitter. Salty and bitter... it was like thatㅎㅎㅎㅎ  
But  
I told unnie  
Oh... if you sprinkle a lot of allulose on it,  
It might be tasty  
But to be honest  
Sion unnie just shoved it into my mouth  
I didn't even have time to refuse……..  
🫧 Almond cookie vs. Dark Dubai chocolate

No, but  
The almond cookie is really good  
?????  
🫧 Sion made it with 100% cacao, right? At that point, it's basically a punishment ㅋㅋ

What’s really fascinating is  
Even when we lived in the same house,  
Sion unnie would nibble on pieces of that bitter 100% dark chocolate.  
Seeing that, I was like  
Unnie… it’s not bitter…?  
And back then, she gave me a piece too.  
After just one bite, the bitterness hit me so hard I couldn't even swallow it...  
Milk chocolate is yummy ㅎ  
🫧 Binnie, have you tried Dubai rice cakes?  
I want to try it

Ahhhhh I wanna try it too  
That day we filmed Signal,  
Was it Tona unnie?  
She was eating it,  
And I was like  
Whoa, how did you get that???!  
And I said it looked so goodㅠㅠㅠㅠ  
But today through Signal  
I learned the truth  
I want to try it someday  
Let’s eat it together ^~^  
🫧 That's it... I'll buy it for you ㅜㅜ

Yesss  
Nom nom  
I'm super sleepy, so  
I'll go to bed first….  
Sorry  
🥺🤍🤍🤍  
Love you
