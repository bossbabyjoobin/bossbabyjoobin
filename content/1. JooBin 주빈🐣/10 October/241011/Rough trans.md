그러나
언니에게
오… 알룰로스 많이 많이 뿌리면
맛있겠다
라고 함………
사실 시온언니가 내 입에 넣어버려서
거절할 새도 없었어……..
🫧 아몬드쿠키 vs 다크두바이초콜릿

아니근데
아몬드쿠키는 진짜 맛있다니까
?????
🫧 쇼니가 만든 건 카카오 100이었다던데 그 정도면 거의 벌칙인듯 ㅋㅋ

징짜 신기한 건
시온언니는 같은 하우스 살 때도
그 쓴 100% 다크초콜렛을 조각조각 씹어먹었어
그거 보고 난
언니.. 안 써..?
이랬는데
언니가 한 조각 줬었단 말야 그때도
정확히 한 번 씹고 코로 올라오는 그 쓴 맛에
그 아이를 차마 식도를 통해 넘길 수 없었달까..
밀크초콜릿이 맛있엉 ㅎ
🫧 빈이 두바이 찹쌀떡 먹어봤어?

The other side of the story... 

(The truth behind ShiOn's Dubai chocolate story)

#JooBin #주빈
<br>


🫧 Binnie, have you tried ShiOn's Dubai chocolate?

Yup, I’ve tried it
She had some today too
🫧 I heard you were the only one who enjoyed the dark chocolate!

......  
I ate it thinking it was good, but honestly...
It was bitter and salty... 
But I told unnie
“Oh… if you sprinkle a lot of allulose, it would taste better...”  <sup>[Allulose = Sweetener, sugar alternative]</sup>
But honestly, ShiOn unnie just put it straight in my mouth, so I didn’t even have a chance to refuse...
🫧 Almond cookies vs Dark Dubai chocolate?

But seriously
My almond cookies are delicious
?????  
🫧 Apparently, ShiOn's Dubai chocolate was made with 100% cacao. That's almost like a punishmentㅋㅋ

What's really fascinating is that even when we lived in the same HAUS
ShiOn unnie would chew on pieces of that 100% dark chocolate
After seeing that, I was like “Unnie… isn’t it bitter?” 
But she gave me a piece back then too
I took exactly one bite and as soon as the bitterness hit my nose
I just couldn’t bring myself to swallow it down my throat...  
Milk chocolate is so much better ㅎ
🫧 Binnie, have you tried the Dubai chocolate with mochi?  
I want to try it too!

Ahhhhhhhhhhhh me too
So, on the day they filmed that Signal
Was it Tone unnie?  
Unnie was eating that and I was like "OMG where did you buy that???"  
It looked so goodㅠㅠㅠㅠ  
But today, through Signal, I found out the truth...  <sup>[Tone's prize]</sup>
I want to try it later
Let’s eat it together ^~^

🫧 This won't do... I’ll buy it for youㅜㅜ

Ohh yeah!  
Yum yum
