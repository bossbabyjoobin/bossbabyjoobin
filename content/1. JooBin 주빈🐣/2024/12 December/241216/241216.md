 JooBin has gotten used to the chaos in MODU HAUS

SooMin unnie came to me and said  
"Bin-ah, your ice cream in the freezer looks tasty"
So I replied 
"Yupp ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ it's delicious"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Then SooMin unnie said
"I knew it was yours because it had bieup (ㅂ) written on it" 
<sup>[t/n: ㅂ `KR consonant for B or P`]</sup>
"But I wrote **B** though?"  
"Yeah, I just like Hangul"
I have no idea what kind of conversation that was
but anyway, that’s how it went…
🫧 She’s basically hinting for you to give her the ice cream, Bin-ah ㅋㅋ
You totally get what she’s up to, right? ㅋㅋ

Right, so I asked
"What’s left?"
But she just walked off like that
I was going to ask if she wanted to eat it
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Do you think SooMin’s upset? ㅋㅋ

If she was, she'd just eat something else  
🫧 She probably thought “Bin said I can eat it~!” and just helped herself

Aha?
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ  
No, but seriouslyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Before I go, I have one more thing to say  
So, there were a few unnies hanging out in the living room
and Xinyu unnie said 
“Our HAUS is a little weird today”
Then SooMin unnie went 
“Unnie, you’re the weirdest one here”  
And I chimed in from the side 
“Xinyu unnie’s always like that”
Xinyu unnie’s facial expression after that was like -> 🥹
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Our house is so fun…
Honestly, before I first moved in  
I kind of wanted to go to Cookie HAUS  
I don’t even remember why now
but I guess I was destined to to end up at MODU HAUS
It’s so much fun (here) 🤍🤍
