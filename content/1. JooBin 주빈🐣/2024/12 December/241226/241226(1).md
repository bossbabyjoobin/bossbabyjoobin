🫧 Watching today's SIGNAL, SeoAh kissed Binnie's hand. Despite being close, HaetKongz doesn't even have a SIGNAL together

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
She smelled the Lush <sup>[t/n: Brand]</sup> scent and kissed it
💋  
I did apply for a SIGNAL but there's an issue because of tour prep…
I really want to film one after the tour is over
I'll take lots of pictures during the tour
🫧 Please give us tour spoilers

There will be stages WAVs have never seen before. ^~^
🫧 Until when did you believe in Santa??

Honestly, I found out Santa Claus wasn’t real way too early
In kindergarten, my teacher dressed up in a Santa costume with a fake beard to hand out gifts
I was like "Wait, that’s our teacher"  
All the kids were clinging to our teacher, trying to pull the beard off
It was total chaos
🫧 You underestimate us too much <sup>[t/n: Directed to the teacher]</sup>

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
🫧 I knew Santa wasn’t real but pretended to believe so I could get presents

That's smart
🫧 Are you using your Christmas present well? You got a pretty good one, didn’t you?

Yuppp!!!  
I’ve been using it consistently since the day I got it
Even 30 minutes ago
The scent is so nice 😚
🫧 So, are you switching from hand cream flirting to hair fragrance flirting now?

Exactly
The scent lasts even longer than the hand cream’s
I’m satisfied
✌🏻
🫧 What kind of scent is it?

It’s really sweet
Now I understand why ChaeYeon unnie said the lingering scent is nice
I always spray it at night 
And the next day, everyone says  
"Wow, it smells so sweet ~~ !!"  
They even said it kind of smells like yogurt
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It’s a scent that puts you in a good mood
🤍
🫧 What was the product’s name again?

I think it’s Lush Super milk?  
Oh right, all the members got their Christmas presents, right?  
Then I saw Lynn unnie holding that t-shirt, I was like
"OMG unnie, what is that? Daebakk"  
But she didn’t know what “geumjjok-i” meant  
so she was just like "What is this?"  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
So I had to explain it to her...
It means someone who doesn’t listen
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅅㅋㅅㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅅㅋ

🫧 Who do you think the t-shirt suits best among the members?

YeonJi unnie...?  
SooMin unnie...?  
HaYeon unnie...?  
ChaeWon unnie...?  
SeoAh...?  
There are so many candidates
