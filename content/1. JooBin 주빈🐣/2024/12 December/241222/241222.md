Oh right, yesterday
Jyuu unnie made some chewy cookies 
🫧 Did you make them together? 

Not really 
but while watching JiWoo unnie 
I realized once again… baking isn’t for everyoneㅎㅎ
🫧 JiWoo said she’ll never forget Binnie’s birthday

Me too
Since we both got it wrong, we can’t forget now
I thought JiWoo unnie’s was on the 13th but then I realized
"Oh.. that’s Naky unnie and SoHyun unnie’s…"
"…Oh right.."
"The 24th!!!!!" 
I just said “Unnie, I love you…🤍”  
Then she started listing all the members’ birthdays
So I asked her
"🐣: How about my birthday?"
“🐻: Yours was just recently, wasn’t it?"
"🐣: …Unnie?"
"🐣: ………….."  
“🐻: Ahh.. January 16.......…”  
So we both agreed 
"Okay, since we both got it wrong, let’s pretend this never happened”

ㅎㅎ 
Now we’ll never forget each others birthday ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
🫧 Your birthday is coming up soon! What do you want? <sup>[JP]</sup>

WAVs' love 
🫶🏻  
😘  
Give me your birthday gifts!
WAVs' loooove~~~~~~~~~~  
🫧 For your birthday, (I'll give you) an objekt

You’re giving me one? 
Thanks
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Binnie, out of all the objekts released so far, which is your favorite?

I’ll think about it after I see tomorrow’s Christmas objektㅎㅎ  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
🫧 Do you have any behind-the-scenes stories from last year’s Christmas objekt shoot?

It was our first objekt, so we were all pretty awkward during the photoshoot…  
We kept reacting to each other like
“Ohh so pretty! 
"It turned out great unnie!”  
“Binnie, you’re so cute!!”  
That’s how it was back then
Now, when we’re filming for objekts
we try everything we can to make each other laugh instead…^^
🫧 Was that when Jyuu left a note on the wall during the shoot?

No, that was before we even met last year
(For CHK CHK) We were filming at the same location but at different times
and I really wanted to say Hi while passing by
but the manager stopped me
It was during the CHK CHK shoot  
ㅎㅎ 
But JiWoo unnie was the first to leave a note on the studio wall
like a post-it to say hello
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It even showed up on a Signal
Back then, I was so nervous
I was like
“OMG…🥹🥹🥹🥹"
"The members left this for us… Daebak…🥹🥹🥹”  
ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ
