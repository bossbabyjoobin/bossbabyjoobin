A belated 1st anniversary... + Christmas Eve...  
I brought a commemorative gift  
But actually, it’s so funny 
I was debating whether to send it or not
There’s a story behind it 
For now, take a look. I’ll send it

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
It kinda gives off a wallpaper vibe
So, the story behind this picture is
we went to a Korean restaurant in Abu Dhabi for our last dinner there before heading back to Korea
The atmosphere was really nice
so we started taking pictures here and there
Then, out of nowhere, HaYeon unnie turned on her camera, started taking pictures of me and said
“Oh wow, this looks like girlfriend material! Girlfriend pic!!!”  
As soon as I heard that, I burst into laughter
This is my expression while trying to hold it in
🫧 Binnie looks like a kid from a wealthy familyㅋㅋ

For some reason,  I hear stuff like that from the unnies a lot...  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋ  
They keep saying I give off "daughter of a rich family" vibes
Apparently, when I try to hold in my laughter, I end up looking like this
ㅎㅅㅎ  
🫧 It kinda gives off a serene vibe

🫧 I like your smile when you laugh but you always cover it 🥲<sup>[EN]</sup>

True….. I don’t really like my face when I’m laughing 😛😛<sup>[EN]</sup>
Covering my mouth has become a habit
🤭  
🫧 Binnie, your smile is already so pretty, I hope you can feel more confident about it

🫶🏻🫶🏻 Thank you
🫧 Binnie, I noticed you always touch your hair when performing. Is that a habit too?

That’s like... a half-habit
Fixing my hair + (I keep) touching it...?  
I don’t even realize it most of the time, so I’m not sure
