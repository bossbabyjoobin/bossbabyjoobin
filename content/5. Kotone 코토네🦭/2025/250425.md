I'm sorry
My roommate today is Nien unnie
and she brought a durian  
The smell got really strong  
and I was trying to figure out how to open the window for ventilation ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹  
But I couldnâ€™t...
In the end, she left the room and ate it outside ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹  
We couldnâ€™t open the window
