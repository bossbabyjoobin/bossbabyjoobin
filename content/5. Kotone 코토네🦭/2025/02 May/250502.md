Just got back from the stage  
I really thought I was gonna mess up
But I didnâ€™tâ€¦!!  
ã…Žã…Žã…Žã…Ž
But honestly, the 7-member version is more of a problemâ€¦  
So this isnâ€™t over yet ã…Žã…Ž 
I canâ€™t relax just yet  
Iâ€™ll try not to make any mistakes in the next performance tooâ€¦
Time to erase the 4-member formation from my brain now
ðŸ¤Ž Isn't there a separate video for that formation/routine??

Of course there isâ€¦  
But the 4-member version is different from the 7-member version
So anyway, before flying out  
We made both the 4-member and 7-member formations  
Then we erased the 7-member one from our memory  
And memorized the 4-member one again  
Now that weâ€™ve finished performing the 4-member version
We have to dig up the 7-member formation from our memories  
If you want to be in tripleS, you seriously need to have a good memory
And once I memorize the Chinese lyrics  
I forget the Korean ones  
OMG
I think Iâ€™m trying harder to memorize things now than I ever did in school
It was so hot today
I thought I was going to melt
It was over 30Â°C??
It reminded me of the Mezamashi live

It was seriously way too hot
Oh and that came out  
The tracklist?  
Didnâ€™t know it got posted because of the time difference  
My favorite b-side?  
Hmm  
For me, itâ€™s Love2Love
ã…Žã…Ž  
What are you most curious about?  
Which song?  
Iâ€™m off to eat now ã…Žã…Ž
Have a nice dinnerâ€¦  
Comebackâ€™s just around the corner  
I canâ€™t wait to see you
Just wait a little longer  
And WAVs who came today
It mustâ€™ve been really hot for you too
Thank you so much  
Alright then, bye bye  
Sorry I couldnâ€™t chat longer
Byeee
