Kotone talks about what led to JooBin’s Cosmo Live appearance

#Kotone #코토네
___

Binnie came by earlierㅎㅎ
It was fun doing today’s live with Binnie
After the fansign, I was in the car and I told her
<font color="#ffde02">"I’m going to do a live later" </font> 
<font color="#ffde02">"Do you want to join?"  </font>
I thought she wouldn’t come? 
But she actually showed upㅎㅎㅎ
🤎 I have a question!  
When will we get the Signal of you and Binnie working part-time at the kids café….. I’ve been waiting endlessly……🧎‍♀️‍➡️🧎‍♀️‍➡️

I’m waiting for it too…  
Maybe we can do it after the concert ends?  
I’m also waiting for the kids café signal and Lucky episode 2…
