What are you doing?
Did you eat yet?  
I haven’t eaten either
Not sure if I’ll even have time to
Oh, is it a holiday today?  <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: Buddha's Birthday and Children's Day, May 5]</font></sup>
Ah, it’s already over?  <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: Substitute Holiday, May 6]</font></sup>
Did you get to rest?
Must be nice ㅎㅎ  
I’ve just been busy getting things readyㅎㅎ
With all the overseas schedules lately
my suitcase pretty much stays packed  
I just swap out clothes and other stuff  
I’ve gotten really fast at packing now
Right now, I’m trying to rewire my brain for the KCON formation/routineㅎㅎ
I did laundry as soon as I got back from China
I even messaged the HAUS group chat in advance
asking them to empty the washer and dryer before we got back  
so I could do laundry right away…
I had to make a reservation in advance…  
<sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: to avoid overlapping with other members doing their laundry]</font></sup>
But the washer wasn’t emptied
ㅋㅎㅋㅎㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋ 
I told you guys ahead of time!!!!!!  
I won’t say who it was
but… that’s what happened
I didn’t get mad  
I just went “Ah…”  
Didn’t say anything else  
But actually, when I’m really mad
I’m the type who doesn’t talkㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋ  
Isn’t that the scariest kind??  
Right?  
I think so too
