Kotone adores JooBin so much

Or should I sayâ€¦ a custody battle brewing between Jjinchinz and Kotone?

Oh, by the way  
I think it was from the recent Atom02 objekt
My baby Binnie did the exact same pose as me  
It was so cute  
Sheâ€™s so adorable  
And the fact that she even messaged me saying she copied my pose
That was too cute  
Sheâ€™s still my bias 
But honestly, we just text each other a lot  
I donâ€™t really message the other members much
since we see each other all the time  
but with Binnie, weâ€™re always sending each other cute stuff or linksã…Žã…Ž
