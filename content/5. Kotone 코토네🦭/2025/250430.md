I'm sleepy  
Now that the concert’s over
I need to erase this formation from my memory
Because we have to perform at the Strawberry Music Festival again
I have to memorize the 4-member formation again <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[Dongguan]</sup></font>
And also the 7-member one <font color="#c3f4a5"><sup>[Beijing]</sup></font>
My head’s going to explode
🤎 But I think Tone doesn't mess up formations often  
Maybe because she always works so hard

I've never messed up a formation before  
Isn’t that impressive?
But I’m not confident about the Strawberry Music Festival stage
We have to do the 4-member version first
Then two days later, the 7-member version one
There’s barely any time in between
That’s why I don’t feel confident
I’ll probably mess up one day too…  
Haha

Who's coming to the Strawberry Music Festival?
There’s just no time to prepareㅜㅜ
I'm not confident that I'll do well...  
I still have to memorize the lyrics too...  
Even the stage positions/movements aren’t sinking inㅜㅜ  
I really don’t feel confident that I won’t make a mistake
It’s such a big stage, so I really don’t want to mess up
But lately, that’s all I’ve been thinking about
I feel like I can’t fully enjoy it
Because I’m so afraid of making mistakes
But WAVs understand there’s a reason behind it
People seeing us for the first time won’t know that
They’ll just think “Why is this person messing up?”  
I hate thatㅜㅜ  
I really hate making mistakes on stage
Sigh...  
I'm scared...  
I want to enjoy it to the fullest too…
