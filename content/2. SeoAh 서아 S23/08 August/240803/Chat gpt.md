**English Translation:**

Heyyy  
We’re  
Coming back from an event in Haenam  
Keke  
Listening to work songs  
And singing with the unnies ㅋㅋ  
Keke  
What’s everyone up to?  
Oh, it’s Olympic season these days  
Cheering on all the athletes!  
Are you watching?  
It’s fun  
I want to do it too ㅎㅎ  
Archery, fencing, and so on...?  
Just  
Something new  
🌊 I vote for fencing because of *2521*

I liked it even before,  
But since the Taekwondo I did  
Was Poomsae,  
And since Poomsae is decided by the total score at the end,  
I wanted to try something like fencing or sparring,  
Where you win by scoring each point...  
I haven’t competed in sparring,  
But I’ve tried it in Taekwondo...  
Kekeke  
🌊 What's your current favorite food?

..Hmm  
Sushi...?  
I've been eating it a lot lately  
But since it's summer,  
Be careful  
Take deworming medicine when you eat it  
I don’t take it ㅎㅎ  
So you guys should take it  
I’m healthy,  
I’m the strongest ㅋ  
About Onotchu...  
Hmmmm  
Blue-keshi  
I’m not listening to it right now,  
But I like it too ㅎㅎ  
I need to watch *2521*,  
But I haven’t been able to  
Though I’ve already watched it a lot ㅋㅋ  
This is my third time rewatching it  
🌊 Don’t you get tired of watching it over and over?

Each time I watch,  
I understand the drama differently,  
And there’s something that it gives me  
It’s a masterpiece  
Oh right  
And these days I’m really into Han Gyodong  
So cute 🥺🥺💓💓  
Han Gyodong is such a charmer  
🐟🐟  
Han Gyodong is a fish  
So ㅎㅎ  
🌊 Han Gyodong is a living thing too, so you should deworm him tooㅎㅎ

Han Gyodong isn’t alive, so it’s fine  
ㅎㅎ  
I also like Bpanjutokki  
Who’s everyone’s favorite Sanrio character?  
There are so many  
As for me  
I like Han Gyodong ㅎㅎ  
Keke  
Oh, sorry..  
I had to go do something  
Keke  
What should we talk about next?  
🌊 Seoa has been trying out different hairstyles lately. Whose idea is it~~?

The hairstylist!  
They recommended today’s look too ㅎㅎ  
🌊 Is there a hair color Seoa wants to try these days?

Platinum blonde..?  
Keke  
Keke  
🌊 What else are you interested in lately?

Exercise...  
Just  
I think it’s because it’s Olympic season  
🌊 What event has been the most impressive in this Olympics?

Most of them..?  
ㅎㅎ  
🌊 Is there a specific athlete you're cheering for?

Kim Je-duk...  
But it’s amazing  
When I was in 5th grade,  
I watched the Olympics,  
And now  
The season’s come around again  
Back then,  
I was a bit sick, so I watched it in the hospital  
But even when I was browsing the internet,  
It was all filled with the Olympics  
It was nice  
Now,  
I’m healthy,  
So don’t worry  
Keke, I’m not sick, you fools ㅋㅋ  
You sweethearts  
Keke  
Of course, I appreciate you taking care of me,  
But make sure you take good care of yourselves too  
Honestly, life is a solo game, and my life is my own  
ㅎㅎ  
Right?  
Take care of yourselves first  
I’m gonna head out now ㅋㅋ  
Everyone, sleep well  
Bye-bye
