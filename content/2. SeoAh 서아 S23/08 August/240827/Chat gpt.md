Hi!
What are you up to?
Hehe
I was watching baseball, but
it got suspended due to rain,
so I’m here.
Looks like it’s raining.
I’m on my way home~~
SSG is playing today..
I’m scared they might cancel it.
We’re winning though…
🌊 What inning is it?

Bottom of the 4th..
Life is a wave - Youngso-nim
It’s in the album I recommended yesterday, but I’m recommending it again, haha.
🌊 They say if it’s canceled before the 5th inning, it doesn’t count.

Exactly..!!!
Rain, stop!!!
Has everyone had dinner?
I’m going to eat.
Seolleongtang-tang
My favorite cheering songs are
for Socrates-nim
and Kim Doyoung-nim.
Looking forward to fall baseball too.
Oh, the mid-game results are out now.
!!!!!!!
Arigato gozaimasu 😲😲
Ugh, still
no restart.
Nooo 😱😱
This can’t be happening.
What teams do you all like?
I should do some research.
Seems diverse..
Don’t try to tempt me
lol
🌊 Who do you think will finish 1st in the regular season?

.. (🐯)
But, you know,
I’m a tiger zodiac sign.
I’m a white tiger.
I’ll bite.
Rawr.
Just kidding lol
Don’t tempt me~~ 😏
Yay!!!
They said the game will restart.
ㅎㅎㅎㄹㄹㄹㄹㄹㅎ
Happy happy
🌊 What if they come back and win? lol

Oh… 🤫🤫🤫🤫
Scary.
No,
we’re the best..
Exciting.
Hehehehe
What else should we talk about?
🌊 I heard there’s a bunch of Seoa in Sohyun’s gallery.

Oh, I don’t know, hehe.
About uniforms..
I’m still debating.
On the 24th,
it rained.
I like rain, somehow.
It feels different every time.
Hahaha
I like what suits me,
but not when it’s baseball time.
🌊 Is there a part Seoa likes in 24?

Yeah,
VM
Super addictive.
Hehehehe
I’m going to go now, hehe.
Bye-bye.
💗💗💗💗💗
Sleep well in advance,
you worked hard today too.
