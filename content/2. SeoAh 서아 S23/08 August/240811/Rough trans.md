SeoAh's summer break is over

#SeoAh #서아

Hi 
The weather's nice today, so I thought of you and decided to drop by 
What’s everyone up to?  
Have you had lunch yet?  
Since the weather is so good, make sure to go out for a walk
Don't just stay at home ㅋㅋ
Time is precious, so head outside and take in the beautiful scenery
It'll be a nice memory to look back on laterㅋㅋ
크크
Spend lots of time with the people around you  
And spend time with me too
As for me, I’m starting school tomorrow 😔  
😑😑😑  
😞  
So sad
