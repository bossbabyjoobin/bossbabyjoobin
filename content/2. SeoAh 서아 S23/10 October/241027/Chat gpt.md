Hey!  
I couldn’t sleep, so here I am.  
“무력-아륜 & My Way Sound” people,  
Oh no, recommended. 👍👍  
It’s been a while since I found a new song, but "Drowning" is really good too.  
Woods-sunbae-nim,  
Are you doing "Gravity" tomorrow?  
Ah, you are.  
Got it.  
🌊 Soeah, is there another unit song you’d like to cover?  

I don’t think there’s one yet.  
Maybe "Door"?  
I’ve been into ballads these days.  
🌊 Soeah, do you think VV’s dance is cool? Would you try it?  

It’s cool, but I’m not a dance member, so…  
I’ll pass, haha.  
I changed my wallpaper!  
It’s a photo from when I was a baby, with my grandma. 😂😂  
🌊 Soeah, how much do you like yourself?  

Hmm, it changes every day. Not everyone can be perfect and do everything well, so I feel different about it every day.  
But still,  
I always try to like myself.  
Even though there are parts I can’t improve, and some things I can if I try,  
I wish time would stop.  
It passes so quickly that I’m always a little regretful.  
Precious memories start to fade with time,  
and that’s the saddest part.  
I can’t believe it’ll be 2025 in a few months.  
Watching the bell ring on January 1 feels like yesterday; it’s still so vivid.  
And in a few months, it’ll ring again.  
One day, I’ll find myself becoming an adult. 😂  
Time is fair like that.  
🌊 Harin, do you dislike becoming an adult?!  

Not really dislike,  
I just think there will be things I’ll miss a lot.  
I think I’ll still have regrets even as an adult. Since it’s not something I can change with effort, I’ll just try not to care too much. 😂  
Ayy, I can’t pretend to be young forever. 😂  
Haha, that late-night mood 😎😎  

Older-Alec Benjamin-nim,  
This is good too.  
🌊 Soeah~ I’m curious… do you still flirt with Joobin these days? 😂  

Nope, lol.  
The cuteness has dialed down a bit. 😅 Even the salon stylists say so – they say I’ve matured, haha. I don’t feel as playful these days. 😂  
Puberty?!? No way!  
-.-
I’m out.  
-3-  
Haha  
Listening to 환호 now.  
Whenever I make a new recommendation,  
I check my playlist to avoid repeating songs.  
But lately, I just listen to the same stuff.  
I found a collection of playlists in ‘애뮤직’ with all my recommendations, haha.  
Fascinating.  
🌊 Soeah, I’m not going to school tomorrow, jealous? 😏  

…  
Get outta here.  
😑  
I love being at home…  
It’s even better now that it’s cold.  
And Seoul is dizzying…  
It’s huge…  
And crowded.  
It’s exhausting,  
so yeah, I love being home.  
🌊 What do you usually do at home?  

Sleep.  
Sleep is the best.  
I sleep, watch YouTube,  
and do random stuff.  
But if I wake up after 10,  
the day goes by fast,  
so whatever I do,  
time flies.  
But I’m always waking up past 10. 😁😁  
On my days off, haha, sigh.  
Heading to school…  
Geez, the nights are getting long lately.  
Ugh, I hate winter 🥲🥲🥲  
Time for the puffer jacket battle.  
Jisoyeon-unnie already wore hers… 🫢🫢🫢  
I’m still holding out for now…  
Next month, though, I’ll have to bring it out.  
Ahh, November  
is almost here.  
Ahh 😱😱😱  
Oh no  
Exams…  
To all the exam-takers, fighting!  
🌊 If you cheer me on, I’ll take the college entrance exam 30 times.  

🫢  
😂😂  
🍀🍀🍀  
TMI,  
but I like four-leaf clovers more.  
They represent happiness,  
which I find really sweet.  
I’ll give “moo-ing” a try later, haha.  
🌊 What’s ‘moo-ing’?  

It’s the sound a cow makes,  
like moo,  
haha. 🐮🐮  
Successfully pranked.  
🌊 You really are a teenager.  

Ayy, look at that attitude. 😑😑  
When I talk to my family,  
I use dialect.  
I think I do with my friends too.  
🌊 Speak in dialect with us more often, please?  

Nah.  
😋😋  
Volleyball…?  
I’m watching a drama…  
I have too many I haven’t seen.  
Other than “2521,”  
I’ll watch something else.  
“Hospital Playlist,”  
that one too.  
I don’t really watch recent dramas.  
Gonna go old-school.  
I’ve been wanting to rewatch “Hospital Playlist” lately.  
I watched it live back then.  
It was fun.  
I used to be into live drama shows,  
but these days, I’m too lazy. 😂  
🌊 In “Hospital Playlist,” which couple is Harini’s favorite?  
IkSong, JunWan-IkSun, WinterGarden, BearBear  

I can’t choose, they all have their charms…  
Well, I’ve gotta go now.  
Rest well and  
good job today too!
