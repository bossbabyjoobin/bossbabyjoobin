Hello
How have you all been?
I haven’t been able to come by much lately
Sorry about that
These days, I’ve been going to bed early ..😅😅
I’ve also been going to school more often
Studying is hard
But it’s fun
The classes are fun
History is fun~
It feels more enjoyable when I put effort into things other than just dancing or singing
🌊 If you had to choose between dancing and singing which one are you more confident in? Do you prefer singing?

Singing…?
I think I’m definitely more confident in singing than dancing ㅋㅋ ㅜㅜ
🌊 There’s a rumor you’ve been eating mackerel lately, does it suit your taste now? ㅋㅋ

-.-
It doesn’t
But as a side dish, it’s not too bad <sup>[t/n: She's eating mackerel to grow taller]</sup>
Wahh
It’s almost 2025 already
🌊 Soda said that every time she sees you lately, she finds you adorable

ㅋㅋㅋ
These days, DaHyun unnie and I have become eating buddies
And she always buys me food…
I can’t help but to fall in love with DaHyun unnie…
Oh right, the new season is starting soon, isn’t it?
I’m looking forward to it too ㅋㅋ
I liked that day~ <sup>[t/n: Objekt photoshoot]</sup>
🌊 The season greetings were also released and it’s a school uniform concept!! Did you take a lot of selfies by any chance,,, 🥹🥹🥹

Ummm
I did take quite a few photos with the 0.5x zoom
ㅎㅎ
But I can’t share them yet
크크
No spoilers allowed
I’ll sing my audition song <sup>[BOL4 -  You and I From the Beginning]</sup>
`[VM Below🎤]`
(*Sighs*) Singing it after a long time makes me a bit nervous
I haven't been singing much these days
ㅎㅎ
🌊 Do you have a go-to karaoke song?

Twenty Five, Twenty One <sup>[Jaurim]</sup>
and I Miss You…? <sup>[Soyou]</sup>
🌊 Is "I Miss You" the one from the *Goblin* OST?

Right~
Now that baseball season is over <sup>[KBO League Offseason]</sup>
I have to watch
dramas and (read) webtoons
🌊 Found any new dramas?

*Family by Choice*..?
Actually
I haven’t watched it yet ㅎㅎ
Since the National Baseball team is still playing <sup>[WBSC Premier12]</sup>
I’ll watch it after that
As for Webtoons
*Powerful Confession?*
I'm reading webtoons like that
크크
Today's song recommendation is Week End by Gen Hoshino-nim
🌊 Do you have a favorite school meal menu?

Ummm
Soup
I don’t remember which kind
I’ll be off now
Goodbye ~~
Have a good day
Bye bye
