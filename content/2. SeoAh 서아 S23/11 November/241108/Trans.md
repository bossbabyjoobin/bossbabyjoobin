Hi
It’s been a while
How’s your November going?
The weather’s been pretty cold lately
so make sure to dress warmly
I haven’t taken out my long padding yet but I plan to soon
Today’s song recommendation is
Love Story by Taylor Swift~
Winter is already here
Time flies so fast
These days, fleece is a must
But today, I’m wearing Bermuda shorts...
😉😉

Oh my
Sorry
I was on the phone with my mom
What we talked about is a secret 🤫
ㅋㅋ
Whenever I talk with my family
my dialect comes outㅋㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋ
It’s a secret...크크
These days, I’ve been going to school more often
so I’ve gotten a lot closer to my friends
I’m in the middle of getting them into baseballㅋㅋㅋ
I want to go to a game together next year
I’m planning to go with all my friends
ㅋㅋ
Anyway, I’m tired today, so I'm going now🥺🥺
Let’s chat more next time
Sleep well in advance
You did a great job today too
