Hi 
Sorry for being late again today
Today's song recommendation is I Fall by Victor Lundberg-nim
This song is really good
크크
What’s everyone doing up so late !!
Whoaa, you all must be tired...  
🌊 I’m nocturnal

Me too ㅋㅋ  
Even though I’m Sunny
I’m nocturnal too ㅋㅋ
I have to go to school 
Can I even make it on time without being late...?
ㅋㅋㅋ
In our class, if you fall asleep during lessons
you have to clean up with your seatmate afterward...
I feel too guilty to sleep, so I’m hanging in there ㅋㅋ
During ethics class today
we talked about the best things that happened this year
My classmates said *being friends with me*  
I’m so touched
크크
🌊 Since it's baseball's offseason, you must be bored these days

I’ve been watching a drama!
It's called Family by Choice 
The reviews said it’s fun
so I thought *“Ooh, I’ve gotta watch this”*
I just started episode 2 ㅋㅋ
🌊 Next week is the final episode ㅠㅠ

Huh?  
Already...?  
Dramas end so quickly these days
Back in the day, they used to go over 20 episodes
but now they’re shorter than 16 
It's shocking...
Everything feels so fast-paced these days
I can’t keep up with trends...  
I may look 15 on the outside <sup>[t/n: She's 14 but still counting her korean age ^~^]</sup>
but inside, I’m totally an old soul
These days, I’ve been more affectionate
Like asking for hugs and stuff ㅋㅋㅋ  
You know that *Hug me* 🥺 meme?
`[t/n: Not sent in the chat, just for reference]`
`[나 안아 = Hug me (Informal)]`
![[GczHJx6bYAAZ_59.jpg|250]]

You know that one?  
It’s exactly like that
[Y/N] Hug me 🥺
크크
🌊 I'm curious. At school, do your friends call you Haerin or SeoAh?

My classmates call me by my real name  
but other students from other classes call me SeoAh
🌊 What is it like being so well-known at school?

It’s like...  
I’m easygoing and kind of an extrovert 
but I’m famous in a different way<sup>[She's an Idol]</sup> 
so it feels a bit burdensome
Everyone sees me as SeoAh but at least at school
I wish they’d see me as Haerin
Yet, they all call me SeoAh so yeah ㅋㅋ
That’s why I used to feel burdened about going to classes, so I didn’t go often
But these days, I’ve gotten closer to everyone, so I go regularly
I even went on a date with a classmate over the weekend
Even the teachers seem to like me  
크크
They say it’s because I pay attention in class
Finals are coming up...  
so I need to focus, even if it’s just a little
Oh right, I’ve been getting closer to students from other classes too
With my personality, I can’t just stay in one classㅎㅎ
I’m gradually becoming friends with everyone
크크
I’m done washing up
크크
I’ve mastered chatting on fromm while washing up
My special talent is pretty amazing, right? ㅋㅋ
크크
But I’m using my phone without a case
What if I switch phones and the touchscreen stops working or something? ㅋㅋㅋ
I drop my phone often while washing up
😱😱
I don’t even have a holder or something 
I just put it on top of a shampoo bottle ㅋㅋㅋ  
My phone is an iPhone 12 ㅋㅋㅋ
but I’m debating whether to get a new one
Do you think the new one can still take those perfectly shaky selfies...?
🌊 You have to carry around the iPhone 12 just for selfies

There’s an 86% chance I’d lose it  
I’ll think about it
Anyway, I'm going to sleep now
Good night
You worked hard today too
