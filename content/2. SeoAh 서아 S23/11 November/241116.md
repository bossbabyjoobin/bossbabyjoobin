What are you doing?
Ohh, the new objekt came out 
🌊 What’s SeoAh doing?

I’m just lying down and resting
🌊 How about school?!

It’s the weekend쿠쿠
Dummy
🌊 I heard about the heartwarming story when you gave Bin half of your orange yesterday

ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
That one
I ate the other half
and it was so sweet... <sup>[Welp...]</sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ㅎ.ㅎ
🌊 Does Haerin have any selfies in her school uniform? I’d love to see one

I’ll try to bring one next time
I’m a gym clothes lover... <sup>[PE Unif]</sup>
Probably...
I’ll be wearing my gym clothes with a hoodie on top
I’m going to be in my 3rd year of middle school soon <sup>[9th grade]</sup>
Still, I’ve been studying little by little ㅋㅋ
When I get home, I take online classes bit by bit
since I missed the start of my 2nd year <sup>[8th grade]</sup>
I’m going through it slowly from the beginning
크크
What’s everyone having for lunch?
Me too, I’m just having lunch at home
Any lunch recs?
My love? 💗
ㅎ3ㅎ
크크크
Today's song recommendation
Polaroid - tripleS
Totally my style
크크
I'll sing it for you later
I miss you too
I hope we can meet soon
I’m also excited for the overseas tour
It's my first time!
크크
Since it’s a tour, it's even better to meet fans from all over the world
Speaking of which, what title should I have? 
<sup>[For self intro, like Boss baby for Bin and Lesser panda for Tone]</sup>
Wow...
There are so many
I’ll just go with
[Y/N]’s girlfriend title
😜😜😜😜
ㅎ.ㅎ
Oh right, how were the pictures that got posted recently? <sup>[SNS post]</sup>
It's a cat <sup>[Probably talking about either the concept or the caption | =^._.^= ∫ 🖤 ]</sup>
크크
I liked it that day
I’ve been wanting to try a bob cut lately
-3-
It feels weird since I’ve never really had long hair…
Well.. I guess eventually I have to try it
크크
I should get going now
Have a great day
Byeee
