Whatcha doing
Haha
It's already the last day of July ㅜㅜ
So sad
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
It went by so fast
Like a typhoon ;;;
Tornado
No no no
Already more than half of 2024 is over
Ha
Time flies so fast
😭😭😭😭
Don't let the vacation end!! ㅜㅜ
🌊 Yubin says not to be sad because the end of July will come back

Whoa
Time doesn't come back.
Of course,
The month and season of July
are the same, but
so much changes with the time and environment, etc.
🌊 Seoa's age doesn't change

...????
I get older too..
Time and gravity are fair..
Hold on, should I send a selfie or not, I'm debating lol
Haha
Let's see what you're doing lol
I've been flirting with Joobin unnie lately
Unnie's eyes, nose, lips
The way unnie touched me
I didn't touch you..
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
Oh right
Today's TMI
My nail fell off
It was a hashtag nail..
It was meant for hashtags but maybe it's time to change it...
Haha
Should I let go of summer
Or send a pretty one
Choose one
You greedy ones
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

Here's one for now lol
![[GTvqfU5a8AADtGh.jpg|150]]
And this one from the fansign
Haha
Are you smitten? lol 🤭
🌊 Seoa's summer object is coming out today, give us a spoiler

I haven't seen it either..
Went to sleep right after..😅😅😅
ㅎㅎㅎ
Zzzz
I'm tired tired
ㅋㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋ
The behind-the-scenes is that I couldn't keep my eyes open ㅋㅋ
Too bright
Maybe we recognize the same sun
With Joobin unnie
Had pasta and
Omurice
Had a date today lol
And lately
I've been playing ZombigO with a friend every day lol
I'm a beginner so I'm always teaching them
🌊 Tomato pasta vs. cream pasta, which do you prefer, unnie?

Cream~🍦
Definitely cream pasta
Today,
spicy cream
Just cream is good
But spicy is
less greasy
so it's okay
Everyone,
be careful of colds these days
Watch out for air conditioning sickness
Be careful of the heat
Be careful of all three
If you carry an air conditioner around because it's hot,
you'll catch a cold
Haha
Onochu?
Go?
How about it
Hold on, customer, Seoa.
We'll find the music and come back
We don’t care- sigala & the vamps
It's full of summer vibes~~
Haha
🌊 What makes Haerin happy these days?

When I'm in bed..
When I sleep..
When I listen to music..
When I call.. etc...?
Bed is the best
I'm E but
it's half and half
I like the bed
🌊 Going to the beach in summer vs. lying in bed with the air conditioner on at home

Going to the beach in summer
I like the beach
It's so open
I want to go
with my friends later
Haha
I want to go to a deserted island lol
The sea and nature..
Ah, I like it
🌊 Seoa, I bet you would sit alone on the beach, listen to music, and watch the waves

I think so too.. ㅋㅋ
🌊 If you get stranded on a deserted island with unnie, will you catch fish for her? Will you light a fire?

You gotta do what you gotta do to survive
🌊 Sunrise vs. Sunset

Sunrise
When the sun rises in the morning
and there are clouds too, it's so beautiful
It's my style~~
🌊 Have you ever seen the sunrise on New Year's Day?

No.. not yet
I've seen the bell ring at midnight, but not the sunrise.. haha
🌊 Stars in the night sky vs. clouds in the clear sky

Both are good
These days I want to see stars but
I can't see them well ㅜ
I'll go to Gwangju and see them as much as I want
🌊 Is there a place in Gwangju where you can see stars?
Unnie is from Gwangju but has never seen them ㅠ

I go to a place that feels like my hideout
You can see them well there and it's open, so I like it
Haha, it's a secret
🌊 Do you have anything you want to do in August? Goals... I'm curious!!

Not yet
Honestly
I can't believe July is already over..
In August
Hm
I don't know yet
Heummmm
I'll let you know if something comes up lol
Everyone, goodnight, I'm going to go now
I'm going to sleep lol
Goodnight
You worked hard today too
