Hello ㅎㅎ
Long time no see
I watched the SIGNAL yesterday
Me too
The video brought back memories from back then ㅋㅋ <sup>[t/n: ASSEMBLE24 promo]</sup>
When did you film me dozing off..
I must have been really tired
I usually can’t sleep in position like that ㅋㅋ
I’ve been watching baseball
And having a good time
Last time I went to a game, it was so hot..
I think I got tanned
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
크크 It’s okay, I’m the strongest…
I guess I’m a victory fairy
they always win
I don’t have a uniform yet, so I borrow one from my friends every time I go ㅋㅋㅋ <sup>[t/n: Baseball jersey]</sup>
There are so many cute uniforms..
Anyway, that’s what I’ve been up to these days
What are you all up to?
I bought a whale keyring at a café
It’s so cute
I attached it to my phone
I’ll show you later ㅎㅎ
Today's song recommendation is..
Sunlight! by Elijah Woods-nim
It's a good song to listen to in the morning, I recommend it
크크
little by little It’s starting to feel like autumn 
Baseball season, don’t end
*(Crying sounds)*
Autumn baseball.. I heard it’s hard to get tickets
Even for recent games, it's been tough..
I can’t do it..
키키
It’s okay
It’s okay~  nang nang nang <sup>[t/n: this is a meme, I'll link it below]</sup>
These days
I want to become an autumn woman
I think I’m feeling the autumn blues
크크크

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
크크크크크
Hurry up and have a marriage meeting
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
This is fun
Recommend me something to eat for dinner
Hmmm
I’ll think about it
I'm going now
Thanks for today too
Have a good day
