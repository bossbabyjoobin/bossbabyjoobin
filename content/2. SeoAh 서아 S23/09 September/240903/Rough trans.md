A little update from Baby SeoAh

#SeoAh #서아



Hello ㅎㅎ
I came to check on you since I was curious
I'm doing well, so don't worry
![[vlcsnap-2024-09-04-13h21m21s492.png|150]]
Ta-da!
I went to the beach with my family 
We went to Pohang and it was my first time there
It was nice
I'm getting some good rest
I've also been diligently watching baseball <sup>[t/n: She's been into baseball, especially after the 240610 Ulsan event]</sup>
ㅋㅋ
What’s everyone still doing up at this hour?  
I'm glad to see that everyone seems to be doing well
I’ve also spent a lot of good time with my family after a while  
I'm happy 크크
We even went to watch a baseball game at some point
When exactly? 
That’s a secret
Today's song recommendation
Youth – OOHYO sunbaenim
HI BYE, GOODNIGHT – Daniel-nim  
It’s been a while  <sup>[t/n: her doing onochu]</sup>
It really has been  
By the way, it's Youth (DAY) version  
Come to think of it, there are two versions of it <sup>[t/n: (DAY) and (NIGHT)]</sup>
ㅎㅎ
My brother asked me to teach him the Girls Never Die dance, so we danced together and it was hilarious 크크
🌊 Is he good at dancing?  

He can't dance ㅋ
키키
Come to think of it 
August is already over and September has started 
I can’t believe there isn’t much of 2024 left  
but that just makes me look forward to next year even more  
Thank you and I look forward to your continued support
I'm going to sleep now
Good night
You did a great job today too
