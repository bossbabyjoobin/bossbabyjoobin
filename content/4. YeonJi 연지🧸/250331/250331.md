ðŸŒŠ Personally, I think it was really fun when you played Mafia game with the members

I totally agree with this ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹  
Back when we were at the company
a few of us secretly played Mafia game once
Even then, I was a citizen but I got targeted first and died
It was so unfair, seriously
This always happens to me
The moment they announce *Morning has come*
everyone goes
"It's Kwak YeonJi"
"Kwak YeonJi is suspicious" 
"Why are you laughing?"
And if I keep a straight face "Why arenâ€™t you laughing?"
If I talk a lot "Youâ€™re talking too much, thatâ€™s suspicious"
If I talk less "Huh? Why are you so quiet? Thatâ€™s suspicious"
No matter what I do, they always think Iâ€™m suspicious
I canâ€™t believe this
I was like "No!!!!!" trying to defend myself but I still died
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹
And after that, they go "Okay, we wonâ€™t kill you first next time" 
but then I just end up dying in the next round too
