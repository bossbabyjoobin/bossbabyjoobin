YeonJi reassures WAVs that her right hand issue isnâ€™t serious

What are you doing? 
I just finished washing up and came to use the massage chair
At least I can get about four hours of sleep today and yesterday
But you know what
At fan sign events lately, whether I sign with my left hand or my right hand my handwriting looks really different from before...  
So please understand 
Even my typing is a bit slow right now..
Thereâ€™s a slight issue with my right hand..
So please understand...!!
Iâ€™m planning to remove my nails soon
so take a good look at them while they last
Iâ€™m just taking a short break from nail art
Itâ€™s not that I canâ€™t use my right hand because of my nails
but itâ€™s nothing serious, so just pretend you donâ€™t know
Just... please understand my signature using my left hand and my messy handwritingã…œã…œ
Might as well take this chance to become ambidextrous
Being ambidextrous is kinda cool
Gotta give it a try
