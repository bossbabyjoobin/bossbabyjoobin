ðŸŒŠ Anyone want to eat with me..? Itâ€™s too much for one person

I wanna eat with you
ðŸ˜–
No, but yesterdayâ€¦  
I was practicing and got so hungry  
that I ended up eating three bananas
Then someone next to me said
"Are you a monkey?"  
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹
But I actually love monkeys ðŸ’–  
They're in my top 3 favorite animals 
They're so cute ã…œã…œã…œ
My absolute favorites are monkeys and ostriches  
They're seriously adorable ã…œã…œã…œã…œ  
Ostrich faces are just too cute  
As for my third favoriteâ€¦  
it always changes, so Iâ€™m not sure yet
But monkeys and ostriches are locked in
One time, I went to the zoo and saw monkeys
and they were so cute I became obsessed
Alpacas?  
Not too sure about them
Geese though
Super cute and funny
But my third favorite is always changing
so I donâ€™t have a definite one yet
