TMT YeonJi's healthy relationship with her parents 

#YeonJi #곽연지

Is there a good movie to watch while in the car or waiting room?
Thing is, I’ve already seen all the released episodes of _When Life Gives You Tangerines_, so there’s nothing left to watch
But seriously, it’s so sad
Like, while watching, I called my mom and asked
“Mom, if you truly love someone but their parents are kind of like the ones in _When Life Gives You Tangerines_, would you still marry them?”  
We kept playing balance games like that 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Honestly, I think I call my mom whenever I’m bored
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Like, “Mom, I’m really into something these days”
and then I ramble on about this and that
So we always end up talking for at least an hour
I’m super close with my mom 
I’m close with my dad too  
Like, when I’m in his car, I’ll be like "Dad, so this and that happened"
and we end up playing a lot of balance games too
The questions I ask my dad are more like
"If I were in this situation and I did this
would you say something to me about it?”
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
I ask my dad more of those kinds of things
🌊 Who gives better answers, your mom or your dad?

They’re about the same
For balance game questions  
I usually ask things that could actually happen in real life
or are at least somewhat realistic
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
