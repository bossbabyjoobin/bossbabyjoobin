Lack of sleep? No problem

What are you doing? 
Yesterday, as soon as I got back to the dorm
I completely passed out on the couch without even washing up
I mustâ€™ve been really exhausted
That day when I was chatting on fromm <sup><font color="#c3f4a5">[t/n: 240326]</font></sup>
I think it was around 11 or 12?  
Actually, instead of going to bed, I was on my way to work

But since there were 24 of us
there were times when I could leave early 
if I wasnâ€™t needed for the later scenes
Back then, I went to sleep at 7 PM, slept straight through till 5 AM  
woke up at 5 AM and then stayed up until midnight the next day
I think my bodyâ€™s gotten used to it now  
Even if I only sleep for 2 hours, I donâ€™t feel exhausted
Crazy, right?
ðŸŒŠ As expected, humans adapt to anything

I guess so  
The power of youth
