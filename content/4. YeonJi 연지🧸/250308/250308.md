What are you doing? 
I was actually planning to come after work yesterday
but by the time I got back to the HAUS, it was already 3:30 AMâ€¦?
I figured everyone would be asleep by then
so I just decided to come today instead
Right now, Iâ€™m at the salon
Iâ€™m getting ready to meet WAVs <sup>[t/n: For today's fansign]</sup>
I only got 2.5 hours of sleep but it's fine. Seeing WAVs gives me energy
I can always sleep after the fansign anyway
Did you watch the SIGNAL yesterday?  
That episode was filmed on the day I mentioned on fromm that I was super happy
Iâ€™d never been to a ranch before, so I really wanted to go
and Iâ€™m so glad I applied for a SIGNAL
I love animals so much ã…œã…œã…œ
I went into the sheep pen and touched a sheep
and wow, it actually felt just like wool
It was so fascinating. 
Like, legit wool
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹
But the alpaca spit on me because  
because I kept teasing it like
*"Should I give you the carrot?" "Should I not?"*  
And then it just spat at me   
At least it didnâ€™t hit my face, so thatâ€™s a relief
ðŸŒŠ ã…‹ã…‹ You messed with the alpaca and got what you deserved

ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²  
But seriously, it was way taller than I expected
I was kinda shocked
I mean, Iâ€™ve been to a zoo before but a ranch is different  
you can actually feed them and touch them which is why I really wanted to go
The sheep were so cute  
I wanna go again next time!!!!!  
It was just such a happy day ã…œã…œ
I used to be terrified of dogs too 
but after raising one, Iâ€™m not as scared of animals anymore
When I was little, my mom brought home a dog without telling me
and I was too scared to even leave my room 
I was 9 back then
ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹
But now, even when I see sheep 
I think theyâ€™re more cute than scary  <sup>[HyeRin can say otherwise ã…‹ã…‹] </sup>

Youâ€™ve seen my dog before, right?  
I sent you pictures before
But today, instead of my dog, Iâ€™ll send you a picture of mine
