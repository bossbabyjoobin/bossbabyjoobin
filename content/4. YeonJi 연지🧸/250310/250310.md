What comforts YeonJi when things gets tough

Sometimes, you mean a lot more to an idol than you'll ever realize ^~^ 

#YeonJi #곽연지 #fromm

___
🌊 A rare sight, YeonJi with apple hair..

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
Right? it’s so rare
But you know, whether it’s at a fansign or through letters 
when WAVs try to comfort me, I feel like I might tear up
I’m not really the type to cry even when I’m comforted  
but when it’s WAVs, my eyes well up
The only time I cry from being comforted is when I find solace in a song
Maybe it’s because WAVs are the first people who’ve ever truly comforted me
I don’t talk about my struggles 
not to my friends, family or anyone close to me
So I never really had the chance to be comforted
If WAVs are ever having a hard time and need a place to let it all out,
just say everything you want on fromm
Even if I can’t reply, I read everything  
Maybe it’ll help lighten the load a little
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  
And just to be clear  
I’m not saying this because I’m having a hard time or anything  
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I’m totally fine  
When I’m actually having a hard time  
I don’t bring up stuff like this at all 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Tonight’s song recs are songs I listened to when I was having a hard time
Happiness – PENTAGON sunbaenim
City Lights – Leellamarz
These two!  
I think I find the most comfort in songs about running away
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Of course, just to say it again
I’m really not having a hard time right now, so don’t worry
If I were, I wouldn’t be talking about this
Anyway, goodnight 
[Y/N] I love you
I’ll also recommend Turbulence – ATEEZ sunbaenim
My blanket is dry now
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I can finally sleep
For real, goodnight💖  
Lately, it feels like a lot of people are going through tough times  
so I hope I can be even a small source of strength for you ❤️
Sleep without any dreams <sup>[t/n: Deep sleep]</sup>
